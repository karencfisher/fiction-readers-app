Winter Winds (Seaside Seasons #4),"In Winter Winds, Gayle Roper concludes her delightful Seaside Seasons series with a tale of romance, crime, startling mix-ups, and a few hard hearts that just might get a much-needed midwinter thaw. After his guardian's severe illness, pastor Paul Trevelyan returns to his congregation in Seaside with a big surprise - a wife he's been estranged from for seven years. It was the old man's ailing wish that Dori and Trev return to each other, and they agree, as long as they can sleep in separate bedrooms.

The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels),"The Attorney, which marked the return of Steve Martini's lawyer-sleuth Paul Madriani, was hailed for its ""well-observed courtroom maneuverings"" (The Christian Science Monitor) and ""crisp dialogue and tart observations"" (Publishers Weekly). Now Martini delivers the most daunting capital case of Madriani's career. Paul Madriani has ample reason to suspect he's representing a guilty man. Dr. David Crone, a respected medical researcher and principal in mapping the human genome, is charged with the murder of a young colleague: twenty-six-year-old Kalista Jordan, an African-American research physician whose body washed up on a beach in San Diego Bay. Forensic evidence links her murder with material in Crone's garage. Crone had both opportunity and motive: Kalista had recently ended their affair, and may have been deserting him professionally as well, moving on to a rival genetic research facility. However, when a key witness for the prosecution dies unexpectedly, leaving an incriminating note behind, Crone's innocence seems confirmed-until Madriani hits upon a potentially damning loose end.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8Cc_Ly4PSwEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2002,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8Cc_Ly4PSwEC&source=gbs_api,0,394,140,9

Adolescente: La Clave para ser Libre y Feliz (Teenager: The Key for Freedom and Happiness) (Spanish Edition),"""Nineteen Eighty-Four: A Novel"", often published as ""1984"", is a dystopian social science fiction novel by English novelist George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He enters into a forbidden relationship with a colleague, Julia, and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PEpoEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2021,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PEpoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,0,150,204,2
"Blow Negative ! (""The Best Novel of the Navy Since the Caine Mutiny"")","James Webb’s classic, scorching novel of the Vietnam War. They each had their reasons for becoming a Marine. They each had their illusions. Goodrich came fresh from Harvard. Snake got the tattoo before he even got the uniform. Hodges was haunted by the spirits of family heroes. Three young men, from vastly different worlds, were plunged into a white-hot, murderous melting pot of jungle warfare in the An Hoa Basin, Vietnam, 1969. They had no way of knowing what awaited them.

The four group members are as different as the seasons, yet they all share a love of one another. Yolanda, a media consultant, keeps it going on with a no-nonsense attitude and independence that are balanced by the theatrics of Riley, a former marketing executive whose marriage has reduced her to a ""kept woman with kids."" Computer engineer Dwight's anger at the world is offset by the compassion of Leland, a gay psychiatrist whose clients make him question why God ever invented sex. But after five years, the once-strong bonds of friendship are weakening, and the group must handle challenges of work, lost love, and a stranger in their midst.

A Stolen Tongue,"“Part rollicking historical potboiler, part theological mystery” from the acclaimed author of The Dress Lodger and The Mammoth Cheese (Entertainment Weekly). A riveting mystery that recalls the work of Umberto Eco and Barry Unsworth, A Stolen Tongue is the captivating debut novel that launched critically acclaimed author Sheri Holman’s literary career. In 1483, Father Felix Fabri sails from Germany to Mount Sinai on a pilgrimage to venerate the relics of Saint Katherine of Alexandria. But at each of the shrines he visits throughout Greece and Palestine, he finds that the remains of Katherine’s body are being stolen piece by piece: her hand, her ear, and then her tongue vanish from their holy resting places. Desperate to discover the thief and save his saint from such appalling desecration, Felix is thrust into a strange mystery that takes him across the desert and plumbs the depths of his soul. “Holman seduces you into a world of priests, rogues, saints, a world bright with horizon, wonder, piety. Her prose, tart, racy, and somber, will sing in your soul a long while.”—Frank McCourt, Pulitzer Prize-winning, #1 New York Times-bestselling author of Angela’s Ashes “Holman tells a fascinating story. From the opening scene in Crete to the harrowing finale in the Sinai desert, she knows how to create suspense.”—The Washington Post Book World “Sheri Holman writes with extraordinary assurance and style.”—Miranda Seymour, author of Bugatti Queen “The best historical thriller I have read since Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose.”—Alain de Botton, author of The Course of Love",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zK7SDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2008,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zK7SDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,0,384,79,4
Gully Town: A Novel of Kansas City,"In settings ranging from Kansas City's West Bottoms to Quality Hill, you'll follow the lives and fortunes of five very different men, the women they love, and the families they create, in G.P. Schultz's historic saga about the settlement and growth of one of America's great cities. You'll follow the adventures of Jack and Kevin, two spunky Irish orphans just off the boat and determined to make their fortunes in America. They arrive in Kansas City when it is a rugged town built along mountainous gullies carved in the mud along the Missouri River--thus earning it the name ""Gully Town."" For Kevin, early Kansas City affords the opportunity to fulfill his ambitions to be a newspaper reporter and to pursue his avid interest in women--until the captivating Mary, herself and Irish immigrant, steals his heart. Jack settles into the business community and his life takes a completely different turn as he helps create the Boss System of politics that continues to dominate the city for half a century. Red is a young man who witnesses the horror of Quantrill's famous raid on Lawrence, Kansas, in the early days of the Civil War and later participates in the Battle of Westport. Red finds the woman of his dreams in the beautiful Melissa--only to lose her when she learns of his past and flees, taking with her the secret that could save Red from a life of crime. Adam, schoolteacher, historian, state senator and newspaper columnist, chronicles the lives of his friends and the growth of Kansas City in the journal he faithfully keeps through the years. Through him, we learn about the turbulent political system that puts Jack on top--and frequently threatens his life. We experience such history making events as the great Centennial celebration in 1900, and the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. As the next generation comes of age in a more civilized Kansas City it faces its own challenges. Michael, a product of Gully town's Little Italy, grows up in violence and becomes chief of the Kansas City underworld. Michael falls in love with the beautiful Beth, and must face the inevitability of his career in organized crime destroying the life they have built together.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9-j_Sw72bekC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,1990,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9-j_Sw72bekC&source=gbs_api,0,145,205,4

Fields of Glory begins as a collection of utterly charming reminiscences of the eccentricities of family elders told by an unnamed and indeterminately aged narrator. In pure and graceful prose, Rouaud describes crotchety grandfather Burgaud with his equally difficult car, a cramped and leaky CV2, and maiden great-aunt Marie with her card file of saints—""A prefatory catalogue of terrifying symptoms refers the reader to the saint specializing in the corresponding disorder.

Taking a pseudonym in the interest of privacy, Bannon wrote her first book, Odd Girl Out, as a coming-of-age novel that involved love between college sorority sisters. When an editor singled-out the school-girl romance as her story's most compelling feature, the book was re-written for a lesbian pulp fiction audience. Unlike most pulps, however, Bannon broke with tradition by avoiding sensationalistic plots in favour of emotionally engaged character development. Odd Girl Out enjoyed tremendous success, inspiring other ground-breaking works, most notably Beebo Brinker. Her sensitive renderings of sexuality also won Bannon a devoted following among isolated lesbians everywhere. ""I got nice letters from a lot of really lovely women, and women who were hurting a lot, and women all over the country,"" Bannon remarks. ""So many saying, 'Thank God I finally got connected with somebody who really knows what this is about.' "" The character of Beebo is among the most-loved lesbians ever to appear in gay and lesbian fiction.

The Pit and the Pendulum,"It is almost impossible to escape the Spanish Inquisition alive. However, Edgar Allan Poe’s unnamed narrator, after suffering innumerable tortures upon his body and soul in the hands of his tormenters, sees the light of the day at the very end of his sanity’s tether. Even despite the lack of supernatural elements, ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" (1842) has enjoyed and influenced several notable movie adaptations. Animations such as The ""Flinstones"", TV series like ""Crime Scene Investigation"", to films like Roger Corman’s ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" (1961), starring Vincent Price and some torture methods found in the ""Saw"" franchise, the story’s famous pendulum scene is a rather fruitful source of inspirations. Yet, despite the terrific torments, the story focuses primarily on how terror is implicitly depicted through the workings of the mind. Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) was an American poet, author, and literary critic. Most famous for his poetry, short stories, and tales of the supernatural, mysterious, and macabre, he is also regarded as the inventor of the detective genre and a contributor to the emergence of science fiction, dark romanticism, and weird fiction. His most famous works include ""The Raven"" (1945), ""The Black Cat"" (1943), and ""The Gold-Bug"" (1843).",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-wTxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2020,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-wTxDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,0,117,106,5

The Rider of the Ruby Hills,"A WORD FROM LOUIS L’AMOUR “Almost four decades ago, when my fiction was being published exclusively in ‘pulp’ western magazines, I wrote a number of novel-length stories, known back then as ‘magazine novels.’ In creating them, I lived with my characters so closely that their lives were still as much a part of me as I was of them long after the issues in which they appeared went out of print. Proud as I was of how I presented the characters and their adventures in the pages of the magazines, I wanted to tell the reader more about my people and why they did what they did. So, over the years, I revised and expanded these magazine works into novels that I published as full-length paperbacks under different titles. “These particular early magazine versions of my books have long been a source of considerable speculation and curiosity among many of my readers, so much so of late, that now I’ve decided to bring four of my ‘magazine novels’ back into print in this latest volume of my short fiction. “I hope you enjoy them.” FEATURING • Showdown Trail • A Man Called Trent • The Trail to Peach Meadow Canyon • The Rider of the Ruby Hills",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pefWRQydjncC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2005,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pefWRQydjncC&source=gbs_api,0,269,19,0

The pair try to overcome their pasts and ensure their futures by engaging in capitalism in one of its purest forms: drug dealing.

But the new life he is making has perils he has not foreseen, whether the self-torture of addiction, the authoritarianism of a state locked in a colonial mindset, or the seeming paradox of how to reunite his two closest friends whose worldviews put them in absolute opposition.

Winter, of course, is no better, but remembrance of its frosts and blizzards and winds that begin to suck away your life before you walk a dozen steps has grown faint by the early hours of a Sunday morning in late June. While some try to sleep, and Sheriff English and his ex-wife try sex, the Reverend Peter Simms takes an early walk in the park and encounters someone counting coup. When the Sheriff's part-Cheyenne brother, Mad Dog, arrives to meditate, he finds the Reverend's mutilated corpse. Mad Dog is the obvious suspect and he begins to hang out in the town jail while Sheriff English widens his net. English picks up several suspicious characters, and an increasingly dark history for the Simms family. The case grows stormier, and so does the weather. As a tornado gathers to hurl its fury on the hapless town, the fury of the killer rises to meet it.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PH-ALskab3oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2000,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PH-ALskab3oC&source=gbs_api,0,168,173,9
Electra: A novel (Delphic women),"""Greenwood fans will welcome her thoughtful second reinterpretation of a well-known Greek myth. Among Greenwood's other talents, she displays a gift for writing songs of the period."" —Publishers Weekly STARRED review In this, the third and final book in Kerry Greenwood's Delphic Women series, Greenwood takes us into Troy as it struggles to rise from the ashes of the Trojan War. But while others have told the story as a struggle of men, Greenwood gives this mythology a compelling and exciting female viewpoint. The women of Troy are in terrible transition. Cassandra, the tragic heroine of the second Delphic Woman novel, is King Agamemnon's captive. Queen Clytemnestra has taken a lover who has thrown her own loyalties into question. And then there's Electra, daughter of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon. What compels the young beauty? What secret is she hiding? What are her intentions? Are they dark or justified? Cast aside everything you think you know about the Electra myth and allow yourself to view this classic story from a different perspective.

Half In Love - Stories,"Fourteen remarkable stories that combine strong Western settings with a subtle and distinct female voice. This critically celebrated debut collection marks the exciting beginning of prize-winner Meloy’s promising career. Lean and controlled in their narration, abundant and moving in their effects, Maile Meloy’s stories introduce a striking talent. Most are set in the modern American West, made vivid and unexpected in Meloy’s unsentimental vision; others take us to Paris, wartime London, and Greece, with the same remarkable skill and intuition. In “Four Lean Hounds, ca. 1976,” two couples face a complicated grief when one of the four dies. In “Ranch Girl,” the college-bound daughter of a ranch foreman must choose which adult world she wants to occupy. In “A Stakes Horse,” a woman confronts risk and loss at the racetrack and at home. And in “Aqua Boulevard”—winner of the 2001 Aga Khan Prize for Fiction—an elderly Parisian confronts his mortality. Meloy’s command of her characters’ voices is breathtaking; their fears and desires are deftly illuminated. Smart, surprising, and evocative, Meloy’s brilliantly observed stories fully engage the mind and heart.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-OKafZfFFaIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2009,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-OKafZfFFaIC&source=gbs_api,0,276,170,6

In the Land of Dreamy Dreams,"In the Land of Dreamy Dreams, Ellen Gilchrist's acclaimed 1981 debut collection of short stories, introduced readers to a remarkable Southern voice which has sustained its power and influence through her more than 20 subsequent books. Gilchrist has a distinctive ear for language, and a deep understanding of her flawed, sometimes tragic characters. These fourteen stories, divided into three sections -- There's a Garden of Eden, Things Like the Truth, and Perils of the Nile -- are about mostly young, upper-class Southern women who are bored with the Junior League and having babies, and chafe against the restrictions of their sheltered lives. Talented and bright, but living in the shadow of men -- their husbands and fathers -- they resort to outrageous actions in pursuit of freer lives and uncompromised love, despite the consequences. This collection first introduced readers to some of Gilchrist's most beloved characters, such as Rhoda Manning and Nora Jane Whittington. PRAISE: ""It's difficult to review a first book as good as this one without resorting to every known superlative cliché...Gilchrist is the real thing."" —Washington Post “A sustained display of delicately and rhythmically modulated prose and an unsentimental dissection of raw sentiment. Her stories are perceptive, her manner is both stylish and idiomatic – a rare and potent combination.” —Times Literary Supplement “Witty, concise and wonderfully varied.” —Literary Review “Gilchrist possess a distinctive voice, and blends a sense of poignancy with an often outrageously Gothic humor.” —New York Times Book Review “Her prose is quick-witted and urbane and as gossipy as Vanity Fair.

"Now, Voyager (Femmes Fatales)","The iconic American melodrama that inspired the 1943 cult classic film starring Bette Davis. “Charlotte Vale a timeless and very sophisticated Cinderella.” —Patricia Gaffney, New York Times bestselling author “Don’t let’s ask for the moon! We have the stars!” The film Now, Voyager concludes with these famous words, which reaffirmed Bette Davis’s own stardom and changed the way Americans smoked cigarettes. But few fans of this rich story know its source. Olive Higgins Prouty’s 1941 novel provides a rich, complex portrait of the inner life of its protagonist and the society she inhabits. Over half a century later, it still offers fresh and quietly radical takes on psychiatric treatment, traditional family life, female desire, and women’s agency. Boston blueblood Charlotte Vale has led an unhappy, sheltered life. Dowdy, repressed, and pushing forty, Charlotte finds salvation in the unlikely form of a nervous breakdown, placing her at a sanitarium, where she undergoes treatment to rebuild her ravaged self-esteem and uncover her true intelligence and charm. Femmes Fatales restores to print the best of women’s writing in the classic pulp genres of the mid-20th century. From mystery to hard-boiled noir to taboo lesbian romance, these rediscovered queens of pulp offer subversive perspectives on a turbulent era. “Like the film it inspired, Olive Higgins Prouty’s Now, Voyager is as striking for the conventions it bucks as for the ones it embraces: a vivid reminder of a time when people crossed the ocean in liners and wore hats, and a hymn to an American ideal of social, moral, and emotional independence.” —David Leavitt, author of Shelter in Place",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RhYxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2012,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RhYxEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,0,316,182,6
Medicine Walk,"A First Nations man helps his estranged father find a place to die in this novel by the award-winning author of One Drum and Indian Horse. “Richard Wagamese is a born storyteller.”—Louise Erdrich When Franklin Starlight is called to visit his father, he has mixed emotions. Raised by the old man he was entrusted to soon after his birth, Frank is haunted by the brief and troubling moments he has shared with his father, Eldon. When he finally travels by horseback to town, he finds Eldon on the edge of death, decimated from years of drinking. The two undertake a difficult journey into the mountainous backcountry, in search of a place for Eldon to die and be buried in the warrior way. As they travel, Eldon tells his son the story of his own life—from an impoverished childhood to combat in the Korean War and his shell-shocked return. Through the fog of pain, Eldon relates to his son these desolate moments, as well as his life’s fleeting but nonetheless crucial moments of happiness and hope, the sacrifices made in the name of love.

Party Crashers,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Love Your Life comes a humorous and heartwarming novel about family and finding a second chance at love, set against the backdrop of the most fabulous party you’ve ever snuck into. “Sophie Kinsella keeps her finger on the cultural pulse, while leaving me giddy with laughter.”—Jojo Moyes, author of The Giver of Stars and The Last Letter from Your Lover It’s been almost two years since Effie’s beloved parents got divorced, destroying the image of the happy, loving childhood she thought she had. Since then, she’s become estranged from her father and embarked on a feud with his hot (and much younger) girlfriend, Krista. And now, more earth-shattering news: They’ve sold Greenoaks, the rambling Victorian country house Effie has always called home. When Krista decides to throw a grand “house-cooling” party, Effie is originally left off the guest list—and then receives a last-minute “anti-invitation” (maybe it’s because she called Krista a gold-digger, but Krista totally deserved it, and it was mostly a joke anyway). Effie declines, but then remembers a beloved childhood treasure is still hidden in the house. Her only chance to retrieve it is to break into Greenoaks while everyone is busy celebrating. As Effie sneaks around the house, hiding under tables and peeping through trapdoors, she realizes the secrets Greenoaks holds aren’t just in the dusty passageways and hidden attics she grew up exploring. Watching how her sister, brother, and dad behave when they think no one is looking, Effie overhears conversations, makes discoveries, and begins to see her family in a new light. Then she runs into Joe—the love of her life, who long ago broke her heart, and who’s still as handsome and funny as ever—and even more truths emerge. But will Effie act on these revelations? Will she stay hidden or step out into the party and take her place with her family? And truthfully, what did she really come back to Greenoaks for? Over the course of one blowout party, Effie realizes that she must be honest with herself and confront her past before she’ll ever be able to face her future.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WGRlEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2022,http://books.google.com/books?id=WGRlEAAAQBAJ&dq=Party+Crashers&hl=&source=gbs_api,0,387,58,1

Fitcher's Brides (Fairy Tale (Tor)),"The tale of Bluebeard, reenvisioned as a dark fable of faith and truth 1843 is the ""last year of the world,"" according the Elias Fitcher, a charismatic preacher in the Finger Lakes district of New York State. He's established a utopian community on an estate outside the town of Jeckyll's Glen, where the faithful wait, work, and pray for the world to end. Vernelia, Amy, and Catherine Charter are the three young townswomen whose father falls under the Reverend Fitcher's hypnotic sway. In their old house, where ghostly voices whisper from the walls, the girls are ruled by their stepmother, who is ruled in turn by the fiery preacher. Determined to spend Eternity as a married man, Fitcher casts his eye on Vernelia, and before much longer the two are wed. But living on the man's estate, separated from her family, Vern soon learns the extent of her husband's dark side. It's rumored that he's been married before, though what became of those wives she does not know. Perhaps the secret lies in the locked room at the very top of the house—the single room that the Reverend Fitcher has forbidden to her. Inspired by the classic fairy tales ""Bluebeard"" and ""The Fitcher Bird,"" this dark fantasy is set in New York State's ""Burned-Over District,"" at its time of historic religious ferment. All three Charter sisters will play their part in the story of Fitcher's Utopia: a story of faith gone wrong, and evil countered by one brave, true soul.

The Medici Dagger,"1491: Leonardo looked upon his invention, understood its powers, and knew he must hide it from the men of his age. Thus, a profound treasure was lost for five centuries. Now the race to find it begins. Hurtling across the Atlantic, a plane goes down -- taking with it a page from the journals of Leonardo da Vinci. In Georgetown, the home of museum curator Rollo Barnett burns to the ground. Only his young son, Reb, escapes alive. Are the tragedies connected? Are they merely accidents or acts of murder? Twenty years later, Hollywood stuntman Reb Barnett, an educated, art-loving, high-risk-addicted daredevil on the run from his nightmares, refuses to believe so. Until a phone call rips him from his world of cinematic illusion, and sends him to Italy on a desperate quest where danger and violence are chillingly real. Reb seeks da Vinci's Circles of Truth, a coded fifteenth-century map that reveals the hiding place of the Medici Dagger, a weapon made of an alloy so light and indestructible it is worth a fortune to today's arms manufacturers. To Reb, it is worth even more -- it is his only link to finding the truth about his father's death, and to laying bare the dark demons of his own heart. But finding the Circles of Truth is only the first step. Breaking their complex code means matching wits with Leonardo himself. And staying alive means keeping one jump ahead of a shadowy adversary: the killer who haunts Reb's dreams. From the brilliant Tuscan landscape to the lush California coast, The Medici Dagger sweeps readers into an intriguing intellectual puzzle that delivers shattering suspense and fiery romance with the velocity of a 9mm bullet.

Barefoot Boy with Cheek,"A wild and witty satire of American college life from the author of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis On his first day of college, farm boy Asa Hearthrug enthusiastically jumps out of bed—and discovers that his pajama pants are caught in the bedsprings. He learns that his dog has died, and his father, in an effort to soften the blow, tells an absurd story about a female bullfighter. Next, the freshman pays a visit to his high school sweetheart to say a heartfelt goodbye, but Lodestone La Toole is more interested in hamburgers than vows of devotion. And when Asa finally arrives at the University of Minnesota—wham!—he gets run over by a frat boy’s convertible. Max Shulman’s bestselling debut novel, written when he was almost as fresh-faced as his protagonist, delightfully skewers every sacred cow of collegiate life. From the faculty expert on “Merrie Olde England” who once spent two weeks on that distant land to the sidewalk booby-trap used by the Alpha Cholera fraternity to round-up reluctant pledges, Barefoot Boy with Cheek bursts at the seams with outrageous characters, delirious set pieces, and gut-busting one-liners.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=COocCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2016,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=COocCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,0,288,130,1

Lydia and Freddie. Freddie and Lydia. They’d been together for more than a decade and Lydia thought their love was indestructible. But she was wrong. On Lydia’s twenty-eighth birthday, Freddie died in a car accident. So now it’s just Lydia, and all she wants is to hide indoors and sob until her eyes fall out. But Lydia knows that Freddie would want her to try to live fully, happily, even without him. So, enlisting the help of his best friend, Jonah, and her sister, Elle, she takes her first tentative steps into the world, open to life—and perhaps even love—again. But then something inexplicable happens that gives her another chance at her old life with Freddie. A life where none of the tragic events of the past few months have happened. Lydia is pulled again and again through the doorway to her past, living two lives, impossibly, at once. But there’s an emotional toll to returning to a world where Freddie, alive, still owns her heart. Because there’s someone in her new life, her real life, who wants her to stay.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TX6cDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2020,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TX6cDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,0,219,18,10

"The Lord of Castle Black (Viscount of Adrilankha, Book 2)","Continuing the swashbuckling epic begun in The Paths of the Dead Journeys! Intrigues! Sword fights! Young persons having adventures! Beloved older characters having adventures, too! Quests! Battles! Romance! Snappy dialogue! Extravagant food! And the missing heir to the Imperial Throne! In the swashbuckling, extravagant manner of The Phoenix Guards, Five Hundred Years After, and The Paths of the Dead, this is an old-fashioned adventure--moving at a twenty-first-century pace. The Interregnum is over. To everyone's astonishment, Zerika, a very young Phoenix, has coolly emerged from the Paths of the Dead, carrying with her the Orb, which everyone had thought was lost in Adron's Disaster. The Orb is the heart of the Dragaeran Empire, the source of all its magic--and the infallible sign that Zerika is the new Empress. But not everyone is happy to hear the news. It's been 250 years since Adron's Disaster, and power vacuums never stay that way for long. Kâna, a Dragonlord, has been expanding his holdings. He now controls almost half the area that was once the Empire -- in effect, the Empire re-created, with himself on the throne. Among those opposing him is a young Dragonlord named Morrolan - the same Morrolan familiar to every reader of the Vlad Taltos adventures. Until recently, Morrolan was an orphan raised among Easterners, unaware of his lineage, but it has belatedly come to his attention that he's a high-ranking Dragonlord, and now he means to act like one. And from Sethra Lavode he has received a gift of immense significance and power: Blackwand, a magical artifact in the form of a sword. He'll find plenty to do with it.

Historia del cerco de Lisboa (Spanish Edition),"A proofreader realizes his power to edit the truth on a whim, in a “brilliantly original” novel by a Nobel Prize winner (Los Angeles Times Book Review). Raimundo Silva is a middle-aged, celibate clerk, proofing manuscripts for a respectable publishing house. Fluent in Portuguese, he has been assigned to work on a standard history of the country, and the twelfth-century king who laid siege to Lisbon. In a moment of subversive daring, Raimundo decides to change just one single word of text—a capricious revision that completely undoes the past. When discovered, his insolent disregard for facts appalls his employers—save for his new editor, Maria Sara. She suggests that Rainmundo take his transgressions even further. Through Rainmundo and Maria’s eyes, what transpires is an alternate view of history and a colorful reinvention of a debatable truth. It’s a serpentine journey through time where past and present converge, fact becomes myth, and fiction and reality blur—especially for Rainmundo and Maria themselves, who begin to find themselves erotically drawn to each other. “Walter Mitty has nothing on Raimundo Silva . . . this hypnotic tale is a great comic romp through history, language and the imagination.” —Publishers Weekly Translated by Giovanni Pontiero",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K3yTai3swv8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,1998,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K3yTai3swv8C&source=gbs_api,0,220,80,6

House of Bones,"A chilling twist on the haunted-house story as five strangers resolve to spend two weeks in an abandoned, high-rise urban housing project that even gang lords and crack dealers avoid . . . Chicago’s Dreamland Housing Project was created to give people with nothing a second chance. Like so many ill-conceived dreams of its time, eventually the project fell into disrepair and disrepute, just another slum ruled by the gangs and the drug dealers. But there was one building in the complex that contained an evil far fouler than the kind running the streets. Here eerie sounds emanated nightly from the elevator shafts and the shadows at the far end of the hallways, and inexplicable, fatal “accidents” were the norm. Here human blood regularly soaked the walls and cheap carpeting as rapists and murderers ran rampant, though none could remember their dark deeds afterward. Now, decades later, Dreamland is empty of its residents and mostly demolished. But one building still stands, thanks to billionaire Ramsey Lomax, who won’t let the city raze the last and most notorious tower until he is done with it. Along with four willing strangers—a writer, an ex-cop, a doctor, and a psychic, each with a reason for participating—Lomax intends to spend two weeks living in the abandoned tower to see if the legends are real. But nothing can prepare these five for the terror they encounter once the front door slams behind them, trapping them all inside. Because in Dreamland, every nightmare comes true.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g8XtAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2014,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g8XtAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,0,83,130,5
The Story Hour,"“Thrity Umrigar has an uncanny ability to look deeply into the human heart and find the absolute truth of our lives. The Story Hour is stunning and beautiful. Lakshmi and Maggie will stay with readers for a very long time.” — Luis Alberto Urrea, author of The Hummingbird's Daughter From the critically beloved, bestselling author of The World We Found and The Space Between Us, whom the New York Times Book Review calls a “perceptive and... piercing writer,” comes a profound, heartbreakingly honest novel about friendship, family, secrets, forgiveness, and second chances. An experienced psychologist, Maggie carefully maintains emotional distance from her patients. But when she meets a young Indian woman who tried to kill herself, her professional detachment disintegrates. Cut off from her family in India, Lakshmi is desperately lonely and trapped in a loveless marriage to a domineering man who limits her world to their small restaurant and grocery store. Moved by her plight, Maggie treats Lakshmi in her home office for free, quickly realizing that the despondent woman doesn’t need a shrink; she needs a friend. Determined to empower Lakshmi as a woman who feels valued in her own right, Maggie abandons protocol, and soon doctor and patient have become close friends. But while their relationship is deeply affectionate, it is also warped by conflicting expectations. When Maggie and Lakshmi open up and share long-buried secrets, the revelations will jeopardize their close bond, shake their faith in each other, and force them to confront painful choices.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NixkAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2014,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NixkAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,0,416,88,6
The Letters of Mina Harker (Library of American Fiction),"In Dodie Bellamy's imagined ""sequel"" to Bram Stoker's fin de siècle masterpiece Dracula, Van Helsing's plain Jane secretarial adjunct, Mina Harker, is recast as a sexual, independent woman living in San Francisco in the 1980s. The vampire Mina Harker, who possesses the body of author Dodie Bellamy, confesses the most intimate details of her relationships with four vastly different men through past letters. Simultaneously, a plague is let loose in San Francisco-the plague of AIDS. Bigger-than-life, half goddess, half Bette Davis, Mina sends letter after letter to friends and co-conspirators, holding her reader captive through a display of illusion and longing. Juggling quivering vulnerability on one hand and gossip on the other, Mina spoofs and consumes and spews back up demented reembodiments of trash media and high theory alike. It's all fodder for her ravenous libido and ""a messy ambiguous place where pathology meets pleasure.""

Mount Vernon Love Story: A Novel of George and Martha Washington,"Always a lover of history, Mary Higgins Clark wrote this extensively researched biographical novel and titled it Aspire to the Heavens, after the motto of George Washington's mother. Published in 1969, the book was more recently discovered by a Washington family descendant and reissued as Mount Vernon Love Story. Dispelling the widespread belief that although George Washington married Martha Dandridge Custis, he reserved his true love for Sally Carey Fairfax, his best friend's wife, Mary Higgins Clark describes the Washington marriage as one full of tenderness and passion, as a bond between two people who shared their lives -- even the bitter hardship of a winter in Valley Forge -- in every way.

It made sense to order Bink, the only one of his subjects immune to supernatural harm, to undertake a quest to discover the wellspring of Xanth’s uniqueness. From the beginning, Bink and his companions, Chester the centaur and Crombie, the soldier transformed into a griffin, were harried by an unseen enemy determined to thwart them. Even the power of Good Magician Humfrey, together with Bink’s protective talent, scarcely saved their lives. Then when Humfrey and Crombie turned against him, all seemed lost.

The Woman in Black,"The classic ghost story from the author of The Mist in the Mirror: a chilling tale about a menacing spectre haunting a small English town. Arthur Kipps is an up-and-coming London solicitor who is sent to Crythin Gifford—a faraway town in the windswept salt marshes beyond Nine Lives Causeway—to attend the funeral and settle the affairs of a client, Mrs. Alice Drablow of Eel Marsh House. Mrs. Drablow’s house stands at the end of the causeway, wreathed in fog and mystery, but Kipps is unaware of the tragic secrets that lie hidden behind its sheltered windows.

The Dixie Widow (The House of Winslow #9),"At the conclusion of The Last Confederate, almost twenty-four thousand Union and Confederate soldiers had fallen on the field of battle at Sharpsburg, making it the bloodiest day of American history. Among the casualties for the South was Captain Vance Wickham, husband of Belle Wickham.

Amanda and Marian Laton are identical twins but they are as different as night and day. Amanda is beautiful but nasty, and Marian is kind but plain—purposely so to avoid provoking her spiteful twin's jealousy. When their wealthy father suddenly dies, the two gently reared New England heiresses are sent to live with their aunt on a sprawling Texas ranch. There the twins meet Chad Kinkaid, the cowboy son of a neighboring rancher. Marian is fascinated by Chad's rugged good looks and his sheer masculinity, but she knows that like every other man she and her twin have met, he will pursue Amanda, not her. Chad is indeed beguiled by Amanda's beauty, but soon he begins to see beyond Marian's carefully constructed dowdy façade. Unlike the tame gentlemen back East, after witnessing Marian's taste for adventure, her sense of humor and bravery in the face of danger, Chad finds himself wanting her. But how can he, a man who's just a cowboy without fancy airs or urbane charm, convince her she's the only woman for him?",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OQn16PLfuAEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2003,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OQn16PLfuAEC&source=gbs_api,0,204,170,10

Requiem for a Lost Empire,"This remarkable novel spans eighty years of the twentieth century, from the author of Dreams of My Russian Summers: “An epiphany of heartbreaking truth” (The New York Times). In this three-generational novel, Andreï Makine beautifully but unsparingly describes the almost uninterrupted succession of violence, misery, and horror that has been visited on the Russian people since the October Revolution of 1917. A young Russian army doctor is sent to distant shores to bind the wounds of those in Africa, the Near East, and South America who are pawns in the global political chess game during the Cold War. Recruited by an intelligence agent, he experiences the bloody reality of revolution on the ground. The book casts its eye back toward his grandfather Nikolai, a Red cavalry soldier fighting the Whites in 1920, and his father, whose story of World War II is invoked with a passion and force that bear comparison to the best writing on the subject. From the battlefields of the 1920s to the harsh African heat and dust of the desert in the 1980s, from the orphanage where the narrator spent his youth to the art galleries and chic salons of the glittering new West, Requiem for a Lost Empire has all the sweep and depth, all the beauty and insight of the great Russian novels. It is, as the eminent French critic Edmonde Charles-Roux noted, “an astonishing novel, one that will surely stand the test of time.”",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WhR1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2011,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WhR1EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,0,25,171,4

Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed),"A literary sensation and runaway bestseller, this brilliant debut novel tells with seamless authenticity and exquisite lyricism the true confessions of one of Japan's most celebrated geisha. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read Speaking to us with the wisdom of age and in a voice at once haunting and startlingly immediate, Nitta Sayuri tells the story of her life as a geisha. It begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old girl with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. We witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup, and hair; pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival for men's solicitude and the money that goes with it. In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion.

When Eve North returns to Athmore after three years’ estrangement from her husband, Justin, she finds the great and sprawling English estate—and Justin himself—considerably changed. But Eve has changed as well. She knows the mistakes she made in her marriage, is prepared to admit culpability in their separation, and now dares to win back his love.

Eve’s only ally appears to be the old family gardener who has carved from the green-black yew a topiary garden in the form of a magnificent chessboard as both a masterpiece and a warning. Hunter’s Green is an involving suspense novel from Phyllis A. Whitney, “the Queen of the American gothics” and recipient of an Agatha Award for lifetime achievement (The New York Times).

Dark Light (Doc Ford Novels),"Imagine hurricane winds over the Sahara Desert, preceded by a cavalry of tornadoes. Imagine dunes flattened, then resculpted. Then imagine all that at the bottom of the sea. A Category 4 hurricane has swept the west coast of Florida, creating havoc, changing lives, and reshaping the ocean bottom. Well-known reefs and wrecks have been covered—and new ones have emerged. From one such wreck, marine biologist Doc Ford and his friends make a chance discovery that will have a monumental effect—a cluster of mysterious objects that lead to an equally mysterious woman and her ancient, gray-gabled estate of a beach house. The woman weaves a haunting story of a loved one lost, and her chance to uncover the truth if Ford will help salvage the boat, named Dark Light, which sank without explanation in the hurricane of 1944. Intrigued, Ford agrees, and begins a chain of events that will change his life forever. For there are other things in that wreck as well, and other men who want them, men willing to commit terrible acts. And the woman herself—the woman is not what she seems. . . . Filled with passion and vivid, pungent prose and some of the best characters in suspense fiction, Dark Light is a thriller of uncommon intensity.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BgydYU1DvA0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2007,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BgydYU1DvA0C&source=gbs_api,0,346,140,9
The Looniness of the Long Distance Runner,"Nine classic short stories portraying the isolation, criminality, morality, and rebellion of the working class from award-winning, bestselling author Alan Sillitoe The titular story follows the internal decisions and external oppressions of a seventeen-year-old inmate in a juvenile detention center who is known only by his surname, Smith. The wardens have given the boy a light workload because he shows talent as a runner. But if he wins the national long-distance running competition as everyone is counting on him to do, Smith will only vindicate the very system and society that has locked him up. “The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner” has long been considered a masterpiece on both the page and the silver screen. Adapted for film by Sillitoe himself in 1962, it became an instant classic of British New Wave cinema. In “Uncle Ernest,” a middle-aged furniture upholsterer traumatized in World War II, now leads a lonely life. His wife has left him, his brothers have moved away, and the townsfolk treat him as if he were a ghost. When the old man finally finds companionship with two young girls whom he enjoys buying pastries for at a café, the local authorities find his behavior morally suspect. “Mr. Raynor the School Teacher” delves into a different kind of isolation—that of a voyeuristic teacher who fantasizes constantly about the women who work in a draper’s shop across the street. When his students distract him from his lustful daydreams, Mr. Raynor becomes violent. The six stories that follow in this iconic collection continue to cement Alan Sillitoe’s reputation as one of Britain’s foremost storytellers, and a champion of the condemned, the oppressed, and the overlooked.

The Dolls' House,"“I Think That Before All Else I Am a Human Being, Just As Much As You Are—Or At Least I will Try to Become One.” –Henrik Ibsen in A Doll’s House A Doll’s House, the three-act play by Henrik Ibsen, which premiered at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1879, is one of the most well-known and frequently performed of modern plays. It richly displays the genius with which Ibsen pioneered modern, real¬istic prose drama. The play is significant for the way it deals with the fate of the central character Nora, a married woman, who at that time in Norway lacked opportunities for self-fulfillment in a male-dominated world. Ibsen was inspired by the belief that “a woman cannot be herself in modern society,” since it is “an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint.” \ The play aroused great controversy at the time, as it concludes with Nora leaving her husband and children because she wants to discover herself. The outrage went far beyond the theater to the world of news¬papers and society. In Nora, Ibsen epitomized the human struggle against the humiliating constraints of social conformity. Even today many agree that the theme of the play is the need of every individual to be able to find out the kind of person he or she is and to be allowed to become that person.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LjXfDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2020,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LjXfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,0,163,73,6

The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge,"While his old furniture rots in storage, Malte Laurids Brigge lives in a cheap room in Paris, with little but a library reader's card to distinguish him from the city's untouchables. Every person he sees seems to carry their death with them, and he thinks of the deaths, and ghosts, of his aristocratic family, of which only he remains.

"Mistress of the Pearl (The Pearl, Book 3)","Kundala is Miina's world, created by that Goddess with the help of the dragons. But Miina is missing, and her people have been enslaved by the alien V'ornn. Now a savior has come, the Dar Sala-at, a messiah promised by prophecy yet unlike anyone's expectations: within the body of a beautiful young woman is the mind and spirit of a unique Kundalan female who is joined in mystical partnership with the mind and spirit of Annon Ashera, a V'ornn male, the last survivor of a noble family. Together the two adolescents have matured and merged into a new joint identity. Now their common destiny, and Kundala's, is in their own hands. In Lustbader's richly imagined saga The Pearl, magic and science clash on an epic scale. As in the Midkemia novels of Raymond Feist, the juxtaposition shows that neither is inherently good or evil. It is the people using magic or science who give them meaning, and Lustbader has created people you will never forget: Riane, the Dar-Sala-at; Eleana, the woman she loves twice over; Kurgan, the V'ornn usurper who raped Eleana and sired her child; Marethyn Stogggul, Kurgan's defiant sister, an artist who joins the Kundalan resistance; Marethyn's lover, chief trader Sornnn SaTrryn, who secretly helps the resistance as well; and the fabulous Krystren, the Sarakkon woman from the mysterious southern continent, who comes north on a secret mission and will change the lives of everyone she meets. All the while, the evil Sauromicians threaten the world as they seek to use banestones to bind a dragon. With each new volume, The Pearl has bloomed and ramified like a gorgeous flowering vine. The Mistress of the Pearl is the best yet, and those who have read the previous books will find new sources of excitement and enlightenment, but this is also a great place to begin catching up with the series, as the Pearl shines ever brighter.

Catch a Dream,"Audrey Carlan has created a gem of a story about sisterhood, love, and second chances.” —Lexi Ryan on What the Heart Wants A heartwarming, wry and deeply emotional story of the power of sisterhood, trusting your heart and finding forever. “Think big. Live out loud.” When their mother passed away a decade ago, Evie Ross and her sister, Suda Kaye, were each left a stack of letters, one to be opened every year on their birthday. While the letters encouraged Suda Kaye’s wanderlust, taking her away from Evie for years, their free-spirited mother’s wish for her more cautious daughter was to discover what her heart truly desires. But steadfast Evie discovered long ago that wishes rarely come true. A successful life stems from planning, building a stable career—and keeping your heart guarded at all costs. Now, with her sister home again, Evie’s life can finally return to normal, until the one person she’s been avoiding is suddenly everywhere. Milo Chavis is the only man Evie’s ever wanted with all her heart, her desire for him matched only by the shock that he might want her, too. But if Evie’s learned anything over the years, it’s that you can’t count on people to stick around. Overwhelmed, Evie retreats to the security she’s worked hard to build, but when a monumental family secret upends her whole world, Evie is forced to follow her heart and trust it will lead her right where she belongs. Don’t miss On the Sweet Side,the next book in Audrey Carlan's The Wish series!

Loving Women,"It is 1953. The Korean War is ending. The Eisenhower era is beginning. Patti Page and Frankie Laine sit at the top of the charts. And aspiring cartoonist Michael Devlin, Brooklyn born and bred, is heading south to become a man. Pete Hamill's prose has always been praised for its energy and muscularity. But rarely, if ever, has he achieved the tough-and-tender lyricism and imagistic power of his sensual new novel, Loving Women. When Michael arrives at the U.S. Navy supply base in Pensacola, Florida, he is immediately plunged into a world he's never before encountered or imagined. Sensitive, street-smart, but wildly naive about the sadistic terrors of the service and the bigotry of the Deep South, he thrashes through a baptism of frustration and despair - until he meets Eden Santana. Eden is everything he's ever dreamed of: older, wiser, nonplussed by his ingenuous ways - the perfect instructor for a Catholic virgin in the art of lovemaking, in sexual pleasure, confidence and courage. Though their steamy passion is destined to dissipate, there is no way Michael can prepare himself for the circumstances under which his enigmatic lover disappears. Their heartbreaking parting becomes entwined with frightening secrets about each other, the South and the friends they make along the way. As compelling in narrative drive as it is utterly convincing in mood and tone, Loving Women's cinematic immediacy and haunting storytelling signify Pete Hamill writing at the top of his talent.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lxkbHhDKh8IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2011,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lxkbHhDKh8IC&source=gbs_api,0,333,155,6

Heiress,"""Greeley’s storytelling is intricate, masterly, and delightfully imaginative. Highly recommended.""—Library Journal (starred review) In this gorgeously written and spellbinding historical novel based on Pride and Prejudice, the author of The Clergyman’s Wife combines the knowing eye of Jane Austen with the eroticism and Gothic intrigue of Sarah Waters to reimagine the life of the mysterious Anne de Bourgh. As a fussy baby, Anne de Bourgh was prescribed laudanum to quiet her, and now the young woman must take the opium-heavy tincture every day. Growing up sheltered and confined, removed from sunshine and fresh air, the pale and overly slender Anne grew up with few companions except her cousins, including Fitzwilliam Darcy. Throughout their childhoods, it was understood that Darcy and Anne would marry and combine their vast estates of Pemberley and Rosings. But Darcy does not love Anne or want her. After her father dies unexpectedly, leaving her his vast fortune, Anne has a moment of clarity: what if her life of fragility and illness isn’t truly real? What if she could free herself from the medicine that clouds her sharp mind and leaves her body weak and lethargic? Might there be a better life without the medicine she has been told she cannot live without? In a frenzy of desperation, Anne discards her laudanum and flees to the London home of her cousin, Colonel John Fitzwilliam, who helps her through her painful recovery. Yet once she returns to health, new challenges await. Shy and utterly inexperienced, the wealthy heiress must forge a new identity for herself, learning to navigate a “season” in society and the complexities of love and passion. The once wan, passive Anne gives way to a braver woman with a keen edge—leading to a powerful reckoning with the domineering mother determined to control Anne’s fortune . . . and her life. An extraordinary tale of one woman’s liberation, The Heiress reveals both the darkness and light in Austen’s world, with wit, sensuality, and a deeply compassionate understanding of the human heart.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u1_bDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2021,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u1_bDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,0,299,89,4

At her agent’s suggestion, she agrees to appear in a music video, thinking the time away filming in the Florida Keys might be just the thing to put her life in perspective. But with two left feet, Kelly only hopes dance instructor Doug O’Casey can work miracles. A former Miami cop, Doug still has a lawman’s instinct for trouble, and the continued threats made against Kelly tell him that she is in danger.

The Alien Factor,"﻿The year is 1942. The German war machine rolls across Europe, crushing everything in its path. America has only recently entered the war, and the price paid by its allies is already high. The war could drag on for years, could go either way...until the day a strange metallic craft crashes behind enemy lines, bringing with it secrets of world-shattering consequence. The Nazis are quick to capture the spacecraft and its unearthly occupants, anxious to make use of interstellar devices that could allow them to accomplish their goal of annihilating their enemies. Realizing what might happen should the Nazis master the alien technology and subjugate its owners, the Allies send in a suicide squad -- a group snidely referred to as ""Logan's Losers"" -- to rescue the aliens and their secrets...or destroy them before the enemy can. Logan's mission is complicated, however, when Russia learns of the aliens and sends its own agent into the heart of Occupied France. A rogue Russian warrior...a traitor among Logan's invasion force...aliens who may be friend or foe...all driven to a fortress controlled by an implacable enemy. Stan Lee's debut work resonates with the pulse-pounding plotting of the mind behind Sgt.

Fathers & Sons,"When in 1705 Kornell Csillag's grandfather returns destitute to his native Hungary from exile, he happens across a gold fob-watch gleaming in the mud. The shipwrecked fortunes of the Csillag family suddenly take a new and marvelous turn. The golden watch brings an unexpected gift to the future generations of firstborn sons: clairvoyance. Passed down from father to son, this gift offers the ability to look into the future or back into history–for some it is considered a blessing, for others a curse. No matter the outcome, each generation records its astonishing, vivid, and revelatory visions into a battered journal that becomes known as The Book of Fathers. For three hundred years the Csillag family line meanders unbroken across Hungary's rivers and vineyards, through a land overrun by wolves and bandits, scarred by plague and massacre, and brutalized by despots. Impetuous, tenderhearted, and shrewd, the Csillags give birth to scholars and gamblers, artists and entrepreneurs. Led astray by unruly passions, they marry frigid French noblewomen and thieving alehouse whores. They change their name and their religion, and change them back. They wander from home but always return, and through it all The Book of Fathers bears witness to holocaust and wedding feast alike.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=375vDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2009,http://books.google.com/books?id=375vDwAAQBAJ&dq=Fathers&hl=&source=gbs_api,0,298,132,4

Luna de Invierno (Spanish Edition),"The magnificent title story of this collection of fairy tales for adults describes the strange and uncanny relationship between its extravagantly intelligent heroine--a world renowned scholar of the art of story-telling--and the marvelous being that lives in a mysterious bottle, found in a dusty shop in an Istanbul bazaar. As A.S. Byatt renders this relationship with a powerful combination of erudition and passion, she makes the interaction of the natural and the supernatural seem not only convincing, but inevitable. The companion stories in this collection each display different facets of Byatt's remarkable gift for enchantment. They range from fables of sexual obsession to allegories of political tragedy; they draw us into narratives that are as mesmerizing as dreams and as bracing as philosophical meditations; and they all us to inhabit an imaginative universe astonishing in the precision of its detail, its intellectual consistency, and its splendor.

Brotherly Love,"In the City of Brotherly Love, a car skids off the ice and ignites a chain of events that changes everything for eight-year-old Peter Flood. Peter’s father is a powerful man, a union boss with mob connections, but all the power in the world is useless to a grieving son. Raised by his uncle, Peter tries to distance himself from the casual brutality of the family business, gravitating instead toward a small South Philly gym. Peter’s cousin Michael—his “brother”—moves in another direction: into small-time intimidation and the trappings of a union prince. Neither, however, can outrun the logic of violence as they’re dragged into a world of bad blood and a chilling cycle of betrayal and retribution.

Against this remarkable backdrop, Stevie makes the sometimes harrowing, often comic, always enthralling transformation into a young adult—socially aware, discovering her sexuality, and proud of her identity. “Whether she’s dealing with a subject as monumental as the civil rights movement or as intimate as Stevie’s first sexual encounters,” writes the Los Angeles Times, “Sinclair never fails to make you laugh and never sacrifices the narrative to make a point.” Winner of the Carl Sandburg Award from the Friends of the Chicago Public Library and named a best book of the year in young adult fiction by the American Library Association, Coffee Will Make You Black is an exquisite portrait of adolescence that will resonate with readers of all ages.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sTAKCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2015,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sTAKCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,0,36,130,12

The Pearl,"“There it lay, the great pearl, perfect as the moon.” A Penguin Classic One of Steinbeck’s most taught works, The Pearl is the story of the Mexican diver Kino, whose discovery of a magnificent pearl from the Gulf beds means the promise of a better life for his impoverished family. His dream blinds him to the greed and suspicions the pearl arouses in him and his neighbors, and even his loving wife Juana cannot temper his obsession or stem the events leading to tragedy. This classic novella from Nobel Prize-winner John Steinbeck examines the fallacy of the American dream, and illustrates the fall from innocence experienced by people who believe that wealth erases all problems.

Moonfall,"It's the 21st century, and all is right with the world. Or so it seems. Vice President Charlie Haskell, who will travel anywhere for a photo op, is about to cut the ribbon for the just-completed American Moonbase. The first Mars voyage is about to leave high orbit, with a woman at the helm. Below, the world is marveling at a rare solar eclipse. But all that is right is about to go disastrously wrong when an amateur astronomer discovers a new comet. Named for its discover, Tomikois a ""sun-grazer,""an interstellar wanderer with a hundred times the mass and ten times the speed of other comets. And it is headed straight for our moon. In less than five days, if scientists' predictions are right, Tomiko will crash into the moon, shattering it into a cloud of superheated gas, dust, and huge chunks of rock that will rain down on the earth, causing chaos and killer storms, possibly tidal waves inundating entire cities...or worse: a single apocalyptic worldwide ""extinction event."" In the meantime, the population of Moonbase must be evacuated by a hastily assembled fleet of shuttle rockets. There isn't room, or time enough, for everyone. And the vice president, who rashly promised to be last off (""I will lock the door and turn off the lights""), is trying to figure out how to get away without eating his words. In Moonfall,McDevitt has created a disaster thriller of truly epic proportions, featuring a cast of unforgettable characters: the reluctant Russian rocket jockey entrusted with the lives of squabbling refugees; the woman chosen to be first on the moon; the scientist who must deflect the ""possum"" (POSSible IMpactors) knocked from orbit or witness the end science itself. And at the center of it all is Charlie Haskell, the career politician who discovers his own unexpected reserves of only himself and his country, but for all humankind. Moonfall,is a spellbinding tale of heroism and hope, cowardice and passion played against the awesome spectacle of human history's darkest night.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y7xXdz_jcQkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2009,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y7xXdz_jcQkC&source=gbs_api,0,173,88,11

When Washington, D.C., chiropractor Yardley Brown goes to his local bank, it isn't only to make deposits into his account. He has long since accrued some interest in Rayne Waters, a bank employee who's too beautiful to be true -- and too beautiful to be single. At least that's what Yardley believes, which is why he has never approached her. Little does he know that Rayne is anything but taken. Not for want of trying, of course. But after barely surviving a dating disaster with her hairdresser's brother and then falling for a member of her church band who, it turns out, is celibate, she's on the verge of giving up. That is, until Yardley -- discouraged by his own slew of dead-end romances -- finally works up the courage to give her a try. The true craziness, however, is just beginning, thanks to a cast of characters who seem bent on botching the young couple's relationship. There's Rayne's erratic mother, who constantly boasts about being a ""good whore""; Yardley's playboy buddies, always trolling for sex; and, worst of all, past lovers who make a habit of popping up and ruining things as only old flames (or previous mistakes) can. Weaving the carnal and the comical in true Zane fashion, Rayne and Yardley's struggle to find love in a world gone mad is a timeless talk about everything that can go wrong in the dating game -- and a few things that can go right.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Hzrd-XNQBGMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2005,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hzrd-XNQBGMC&source=gbs_api,0,447,170,10

Brother of Sleep: A Novel,"“A highly unusual tale about an unrecognized musical genius,” this acclaimed debut novel “touches the grand questions about God, love, art and history” (Publishers Weekly). Set against the backdrop of a nineteenth century Alpine village, Brother of Sleep tells the story of Johannes Elias Alder, a musical genius with an uncanny ear who develops his talent in secret midnight sessions at the church organ.

A thief and a nobleman, both down on their luck, cross paths on a bitter winter’s day in 1701.

The Academy,"Kate Connelly should be careful what she wishes for. Just seventeen, she already feels like she's suffocating. Since her mother's death, her father has basically checked out, so she's stuck raising her brothers by herself out in the New Mexico scrub. All Kate wants is a little distraction from the same-ole, same-ole that is her life. When two mysterious guys show up at the diner where she works, she thinks her wish has come true, until they start giving her a hard time. Like her life isn't hard enough. Something about them niggles her, but she brushes it off. She's never going to see them again anyway . . . right? Then they appear in an alley one night, to either rescue or kidnap her (she's still not sure which), before disappearing like figments of her imagination. Kate decides to put the bizarre encounters out of her mind. She has bigger problems to worry about: like that elite military academy that's been pursuing her gifted little brother. When one of their cadets shows up at school, he creates instant pandemonium. And just happens to be one of those mysterious guys. Coincidence? Mama said there's no such thing. And to always trust her instinct. But that might be kind of hard, because every time she's around Cadet Peter Davenport, her gut starts flip-flopping on her. And her heart.

When the Emperor Was Divine,"From the bestselling, award-winning author of The Buddha in the Attic, this commanding debut novel paints a portrait of the Japanese incarceration camps that is both a haunting evocation of a family in wartime and a resonant lesson for our times. On a sunny day in Berkeley, California, in 1942, a woman sees a sign in a post office window, returns to her home, and matter-of-factly begins to pack her family's possessions. Like thousands of other Japanese Americans they have been reclassified, virtually overnight, as enemy aliens and are about to be uprooted from their home and sent to a dusty incarceration camp in the Utah desert. In this lean and devastatingly evocative first novel, Julie Otsuka tells their story from five flawlessly realized points of view and conveys the exact emotional texture of their experience: the thin-walled barracks and barbed-wire fences, the omnipresent fear and loneliness, the unheralded feats of heroism.

Not hardship, not isolation, not even her own loneliness posed the greatest threat; it was the land itself that took away both love and livelihood. Robley Wilson's The World Still Melting tells the story of the Toblers and their friends Harvey and Nancy Riker, whose abusive marriage ultimately costs the Toblers their happiness, and Burton Stone, the man in the middle, whose affair with Nancy is the literal trigger of the novel's action. Good and evil play out on these three family farms, whose very existence is a vanishing part of a heartland giving way to corporate avarice. The Iowa of Wilson's novel is a place where keeping land and home has become a dehumanizing territorial battle, and where small farmers like Paul, Harvey, and Burton face the whims of governments, banks, and weather that bring drought one year and deluge the next. Writing with great compassion, honesty, and remarkable skill, Wilson shows here what happens to real people in a hard place, where the traditional world is slowly but steadily melting away.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cbb0wAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,2005,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cbb0wAEACAAJ&dq=The+World+Still+Melting&hl=&source=gbs_api,0,371,184,6

The SUICIDE CLUB.,"In Rachel Heng's debut set in near future New York City—where lives last three hundred years and the pursuit of immortality is all-consuming—Lea must choose between her estranged father and her chance to live forever. Lea Kirino is a “Lifer,” which means that a roll of the genetic dice has given her the potential to live forever—if she does everything right. And Lea is an overachiever. She’s a successful trader on the New York exchange—where instead of stocks, human organs are now bought and sold—she has a beautiful apartment, and a fiancé who rivals her in genetic perfection. And with the right balance of HealthTechTM, rigorous juicing, and low-impact exercise, she might never die. But Lea’s perfect life is turned upside down when she spots her estranged father on a crowded sidewalk. His return marks the beginning of her downfall as she is drawn into his mysterious world of the Suicide Club, a network of powerful individuals and rebels who reject society’s pursuit of immortality, and instead choose to live—and die—on their own terms. In this future world, death is not only taboo; it’s also highly illegal. Soon Lea is forced to choose between a sanitized immortal existence and a short, bittersweet time with a man she has never really known, but who is the only family she has left in the world.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JDFbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2018,http://books.google.com/books?id=JDFbDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+SUICIDE+CLUB.&hl=&source=gbs_api,0,344,95,2
Pemberley (Charnwood Library),"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a married man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a son and heir... Thus begins Emma Tennant's inspired sequel to Jane Austen's most beloved novel, Pride and Prejudice. With wit and style and genuine insight into character, Pemberley brilliantly delineates the perils and pleasures of a marriage between two people as strong-willed and prickly as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. A year after wedding, Christmas approaches. As happy as she has been living in relative seclusion with Mr. Darcy and his sister Georgiana at their magnificent Derbyshire estate, Pemberley, Elizabeth is sensible that the time has come to invite her mother and sister to visit her. What begins as a small and manageable family party (although any party any includes the regrettable Mrs. Bennet will take considerable managing) soon grows all out of proportion. A gathering including the Bennets, the Bingleys, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh-as affable and condescending as ever-can only mean missteps, gaffes and hurt feelings. When Darcy becomes increasingly distant and Elizabeth falls prey to vicious gossip, the forces of pride and prejudice are at work once again.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tJEwhwQADDgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,1995,http://books.google.com/books?id=tJEwhwQADDgC&dq=Pemberley+(Charnwood+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api,0,134,43,4
The Empress of the Splendid Season,"Oscar Hijuelos vividly brings to life the joys, desires, and disappointment of American life witnessed through the experience of a formerly prosperous Cuban émigré named Lydia Espana--now a cleaning woman in New York. In magnetic prose, he juxtaposes Lydia's tale with the stories of her clients, contrasting her experiences with the secret lives of those for whom she works. No one writes better of love or the pulse of a city, nor has any writer better captured the complexity inherent in the emigration experience; how assimilation is at once the achievement of dreams, yet also a loss of the past. Empress of the Splendid Season is Hijuelos at his masterful best, a novel filled with incantatory, rhythmic prose and rich in heartfelt vision.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lObe-ucGeoIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,2000,http://books.google.nl/books?id=lObe-ucGeoIC&dq=The+Empress+of+the+Splendid+Season&hl=&source=gbs_api,0,318,88,6

Stanton stared at the gray-white battleship. 'It's a Dreadnought.' But that kind of ship ceased sailing three-quarters of a century ago. It starts as a trip to help five troubled teens, courtesy of a new Navy youth program. With retired submarine commander J.D. Stanton serving as captain and two young naval officers heading the expedition, the state-of-the-art catamaran leaves port. It's a routine voyage . . . until a mysterious storm pulls Stanton and his crew into an eerie world of swirling mist and silence. There is no sun, no moon or stars, no way to take a bearing.

Blood Sugar,"An utterly delicious debut thriller that tells the story of the most likable murderess you will ever meet, perfect for fans of Riley Sager and Jessica Knoll. “I could just kill you right now!” It’s something we’ve all thought at one time or another. But Ruby has actually acted on it. Three times, to be exact. Though she may be a murderer, Ruby is not a sociopath. She is an animal-loving therapist with a thriving practice. She’s felt empathy and sympathy. She’s had long-lasting friendships and relationships, and has a husband, Jason, whom she adores. But the homicide detectives at Miami Beach PD are not convinced of her happy marriage. When we meet Ruby, she is in a police interrogation room, being accused of Jason’s murder. Which, ironically, is one murder that she did not commit, though a scandal-obsessed public believes differently. As she undergoes questioning, Ruby’s mind races back to all the details of her life that led her to this exact moment, and to the three dead bodies in her wake. Because though she may not have killed her husband, Ruby certainly isn’t innocent. Alternating between Ruby’s memories of her past crimes and her present-day fight to clear her name, Blood Sugar is a twisty, clever debut with an unforgettable protagonist who you can’t help but root for—an addicting mixture of sour and sweet.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zKZPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2022,http://books.google.com/books?id=zKZPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Blood+Sugar&hl=&source=gbs_api,0,380,140,9

When a bureaucratic mistake allows a terrorist attack to occur, CIA operative Steve Decker leaves the spy world in disgust. Seeking a new life, he moves to picturesque Santa Fe, New Mexico, and for the first time allows himself to think about something other than global intrigue and violence. He even lowers his guard sufficiently to commit himself to a relationship, but after his lover’s house explodes and she is seen escaping with an unknown man, Steve discovers that she has a mysterious past and that she knows he once worked for the CIA. Did she love him, or was she only using him as a bodyguard? Drawn back into the world of deceit and treachery, Steve will stop at nothing in his desperate cross-country quest to find his lover and learn the truth. “David Morrell is a master of suspense.

Consider the lilies,"Now considered a modern classic, CONSIDER THE LILIES focuses on the eviction of an old woman from her croft. The Highland Clearances, the eviction of crofters from their homes between 1792 and the 1850s, was one of the cruellest episodes in Scotland's history. In CONSIDER THE LILIES Iain Crichton Smith captures its impact through the thoughts and memories of an old woman who has lived all her life within the narrow confines of her community. Alone and bewildered by the demands of the factor, Patrick Sellar, she approaches the minister for help, only to have her faith shattered by his hypocrisy. She finds comfort, however, from a surprising source: Donald Macleod, an imaginative and self-educated man who has been ostracised by his neighbours, not least by Mrs Scott herself, on account of his atheism. Through him and through the circumstances forced upon her, the old woman achieves new strength. Written with compassion, in spare, simple prose, Consider the Lilies is a moving testament to the enduring qualities which enable the oppressed to triumph in defeat.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EB4UCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2015,http://books.google.nl/books?id=EB4UCAAAQBAJ&dq=Consider+the+lilies&hl=&source=gbs_api,0,166,82,4

Hard to believe, but interestingly, the sub-tropical region amongst the Himalayas that he describes finding, was later documented by explorers from National Geographic, then 'covered up' (there is still evidence of this).

Testimony,"At a New England boarding school, a sex scandal is about to break. Even more shocking than the sexual acts themselves is the fact that they were caught on videotape.

Writing with a pace and intensity surpassing even her own greatest work, Anita Shreve delivers in Testimony a gripping emotional drama with the impact of a thriller. No one more compellingly explores the dark impulses that sway the lives of seeming innocents, the needs and fears that drive ordinary men and women into intolerable dilemmas, and the ways in which our best intentions can lead to our worst transgressions.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B1w_VXw3aOIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2008,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B1w_VXw3aOIC&source=gbs_api,0,26,107,1
"Jinxed (Regan Reilly Mysteries, No. 6)","Carol Higgins Clark, bestselling author of Fleeced and co-author with Mary Higgins Clark of He Sees You When You're Sleeping, returns in top form in her new Regan Reilly mystery, blending her talent for intriguing locales, eccentric characters, and fast-paced suspense laced with humor. In Jinxed, smart, saucy sleuth Regan Reilly faces a new challenge -- the case of the missing wedding guest. Regan, an L.A.-based private detective, returns to her office after a vacation with her beau, Jack ""no relation"" Reilly. Their tour of the wineries in Napa Valley and Santa Barbara County is cut short when Jack has to fly back to New York City, where he is the head of the Major Case Squad of the NYPD. Their last stop had been at Altered States, a run-down winery owned by three siblings who are all former hippies -- Lilac, Earl, and Leon Weldon. Not knowing how soon it would be put to use, Regan leaves her business card behind. Within minutes of being back to work, Regan gets an excited call from Lilac. The Weldon family has been invited to the wedding of ninety-three-year-old Lucretia Standish, a former silent-screen star, who made a killing in a dot-com before it went bankrupt. Lucretia had been married to the Weldons' Uncle Haskell and had invested the money she inherited from Haskell in the dot-com. Lucretia's maid, Phyllis, clues Lilac in on the fact that Lucretia plans to give the Weldons $2 million each -- if they all show up at the wedding. The wedding is two days away, and there is only one problem -- Lilac's daughter, Whitney, aka Freshness, a young actress, has taken off on one of her go-with-the-flow weekends. Whitney is out of touch and goes where the wind blows. If it doesn't blow her back into town by Sunday morning, the Weldon family will be out $8 million. Regan's job is to find Whitney. But unbeknownst to Regan, there's someone else on the hunt. Lucretia's fiancé, the much younger Edward Fields, has hired an accomplice in crime to locate Whitney and keep her away from the wedding. Edward knows Whitney will recognize him as the con man she'd met in acting class in New York. He wants to say ""I do"" to Lucretia and her millions before Whitney can protest. When Edward finds out that Regan Reilly has been hired to find the missing Whitney, he gives the order to get rid of her as well. Meanwhile, Lucretia is befriended by a gang of bikers, the story of her upcoming nuptials is featured on national television news, and wildfires are threatening to consume the barn where Whitney is being held captive. As in her previous novels, Carol Higgins Clark has created a novel that is both exciting and vastly entertaining. As no less a master of suspense than Nelson DeMille has said, ""Clark's writing is elegantly clear and concise, her characters are witty and engaging, and her plots and pacing are perfect.""

The Ruby,"A New York Times bestseller and Oprah Book Club 2.0 selection, the epic, unforgettable story of a man determined to protect the woman he loves from the town desperate to destroy her. This beautiful and devastating debut heralds the arrival of a major new voice in fiction. Ephram Jennings has never forgotten the beautiful girl with the long braids running through the piney woods of Liberty, their small East Texas town. Young Ruby Bell, “the kind of pretty it hurt to look at,” has suffered beyond imagining, so as soon as she can, she flees suffocating Liberty for the bright pull of 1950s New York. Ruby quickly winds her way into the ripe center of the city—the darkened piano bars and hidden alleyways of the Village—all the while hoping for a glimpse of the red hair and green eyes of her mother. When a telegram from her cousin forces her to return home, thirty-year-old Ruby finds herself reliving the devastating violence of her girlhood. With the terrifying realization that she might not be strong enough to fight her way back out again, Ruby struggles to survive her memories of the town’s dark past. Meanwhile, Ephram must choose between loyalty to the sister who raised him and the chance for a life with the woman he has loved since he was a boy. Full of life, exquisitely written, and suffused with the pastoral beauty of the rural South, Ruby is a transcendent novel of passion and courage. This wondrous page-turner rushes through the red dust and gossip of Main Street, to the pit fire where men swill bootleg outside Bloom’s Juke, to Celia Jennings’s kitchen, where a cake is being made, yolk by yolk, that Ephram will use to try to begin again with Ruby. Utterly transfixing, with unforgettable characters, riveting suspense, and breathtaking, luminous prose, Ruby offers an unflinching portrait of man’s dark acts and the promise of the redemptive power of love. Ruby was a finalist for the PEN America Robert Bingham Debut Novel Award, a Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers selection, and an Indie Next Pick.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lPeKDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2015,http://books.google.com/books?id=lPeKDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Ruby&hl=&source=gbs_api,0,81,97,6

But, friend Beth, I am afraid my heart betrays my wisdom—for I, too, long to be seen as beautiful. Not just by anyone. By Dirk Bridger. Your friend, Inga Linberg In rural Iowa, life is both the planter and uprooter of dreams.

Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold,"""Till We Have Faces"" is a retelling of a story about Cupid and Psyche. This story had haunted Lewis all his life, because he realized that some of the main characters' actions were illogical. As a consequence, his retelling of the story is characterized by a highly developed character, the narrator, with the reader being drawn into her reasoning and her emotions. This was his last novel, and he considered it his most mature, written in conjunction with his wife, Joy Davidman. The first part of the book is written from the perspective of Psyche's older sister Orual, as an accusation against the gods. The story is set in the fictive kingdom of Glome, a primitive city-state whose people have occasional contact with civilized Hellenistic Greece. In the second part of the book, the narrator undergoes a change of mindset (Lewis would use the term conversion) and understands that her initial accusation was tainted by her own failings and shortcomings, and that the gods are lovingly present in humans' lives. Clive Staples Lewis (1898-1963) was a British novelist, poet, academic, medievalist, lay theologian and Christian apologist. He is best known for his fictional work, especially The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Space Trilogy, and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, such as Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Problem of Pain.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G3VODwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,2017,http://books.google.nl/books?id=G3VODwAAQBAJ&dq=Till+We+Have+Faces:+A+Myth+Retold&hl=&source=gbs_api,0,54,120,6

Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. An honest, evocative, and tender novel, It Ends with Us is “a glorious and touching read, a forever keeper.

Andre Von Kunst, owner of Von Kunst Gallery, Berlin, finds himself fascinated by Katya Preznoski, first violinist with the Polish State Orchestra. Determined to meet her in person, he follows the orchestra across Germany, as his partner, Hannelore Hassenfeld, a friend since childhood, manages the gallery. Unbeknownst to Andre, she continues to perpetuate an illicit plan set up by her father with a group of former Nazi government officials, known as the Kreis, to funnel stolen artworks to the gallery for eventual sale in the U.S. An unlikely turn of events sheds light on personal betrayals, blatant prejudices, unrequited love, and conflicting loyalties, as this intense journey into the German society of the sixties proffers that things are not often what they appear to be.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l23tq88uxHUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2007,http://books.google.nl/books?id=l23tq88uxHUC&dq=The+Malcontents&hl=&source=gbs_api,0,348,180,4
The Exorcist,"Originally published in 1971, The Exorcist, one of the most controversial novels ever written, went on to become a literary phenomenon: It spent fifty-seven weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, seventeen consecutively at number one. Inspired by a true story of a child’s demonic possession in the 1940s, William Peter Blatty created an iconic novel that focuses on Regan, the eleven-year-old daughter of a movie actress residing in Washington, D.C. A small group of overwhelmed yet determined individuals must rescue Regan from her unspeakable fate, and the drama that ensues is gripping and unfailingly terrifying. Two years after its publication, The Exorcist was, of course, turned into a wildly popular motion picture, garnering ten Academy Award nominations. On opening day of the film, lines of the novel’s fans stretched around city blocks. In Chicago, frustrated moviegoers used a battering ram to gain entry through the double side doors of a theater. In Kansas City, police used tear gas to disperse an impatient crowd who tried to force their way into a cinema. The three major television networks carried footage of these events; CBS’s Walter Cronkite devoted almost ten minutes to the story. The Exorcist was, and is, more than just a novel and a film: it is a true landmark. Purposefully raw and profane, The Exorcist still has the extraordinary ability to disturb readers and cause them to forget that it is “just a story.” Published here in this beautiful fortieth anniversary edition, it remains an unforgettable reading experience and will continue to shock and frighten a new generation of readers.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=akGyuQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,2011,http://books.google.com/books?id=akGyuQAACAAJ&dq=The+Exorcist&hl=&source=gbs_api,0,442,87,5
Within the Tides: Library Edition,"'Within the Tides' is a collection of four short stories devoted to a motley crew of sailors scattered across all corners of the globe exchanging tales sharply punctuated by leitmotifs of loyalty and betrayal, staples of Conrad's. Ranging from a sociopath loner who is tempted to join the ranks of the very same society he so ardently shuns, to stories of hypocrisy, disloyalty, unearthed treasure and blood-soaked colonial encounters at the other end of the world, Conrad’s collection abounds in trials of character and consciousness, rich and beautiful tapestries of language, psychological rambles and profound moral insights with a tragic twist. If you enjoyed Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow in Disney’s ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’, don’t hesitate to start reading ‘Within the Tides'. ""Here, then, we have a master of the English language."" - F.R. Leavis Joseph Conrad (1857-1924) was a Polish-born author who left Poland in his teens to avoid enlistment in the Russian Army.

Unfriendly? Maybe. Understandable? Yes, since a loathsome administrator gave Rose’s beloved world history classes to Martin, knowing it would hurt her. But keeping her distance from a man as warm and kind as Martin will prove challenging, even for a stubborn, guarded ice queen.

At forty, Madame Wu is beautiful and much respected as the wife of one of China’s oldest upper-class houses.

The glass-sided ants' nest,"Winner of the CWA Gold Dagger: Scotland Yard’s James Pibble puzzles over the murder of a pygmy tribesman in the middle of London in this “first class” mystery (The Times Literary Supplement). Oddball cases are James Pibble’s specialty. But the brutal bludgeoning of the revered elder of a New Guinea tribesman may be his strangest yet. The corpse, in striped pajamas, lies in the middle of a room completely absent of furniture. Seven women squat on the floorboards. One knits. Another sits cross-legged at his feet. They all chant incantations in a strange language. The murder weapon, a wooden balustrade ornament in the shape of an owl, could have been wielded by any of the myriad suspects Pibble meets at Flagg Terrace, the London residence where the Ku family currently lives. And the only clue seems to be an Edwardian penny. So who killed bearded, four-foot-tall Aaron Ku? Everyone seems to have an alibi, including a local real estate agent, a professional escort, and an anthropologist whose marriage into the tribe was forbidden. In a house where men and women live in separate quarters, Pibble must follow a hierarchy of primitive rituals and gender-role reversals to unmask a surprising killer. The Glass-Sided Ants’ Nest is the 1st book in the James Pibble Mysteries, but you may enjoy reading the series in any order.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yiSDBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2015,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yiSDBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,0,335,130,9
A Charmed Place,"From USA TODAY bestselling author Antoinette Stockenberg comes an original and wonderfully romantic story of star-crossed lovers who have been apart for twenty years and who rediscover one another in an idyllic coastal village on Cape Cod. A SECOND CHANCE AT LOVE. It's a deep, aching need for anyone whose heart has ever been broken. Maddie Regan and Dan Hawke were college lovers who were compelled to go separate ways after a horrific event for which Dan was blamed. She settled down and raised a family; he roamed the planet as a war correspondent. But a near death experience brings Dan in search of the only woman he has ever loved. His plan to win Maddie is simple: take up residence in a lighthouse just a stone's throw from her family's summer home, and then make her fall back in love with him. He knows her family will object and suspects that her daughter might; but he refuses to believe that Maddie herself -- the woman who has haunted his dreams for two decades -- can be any less in love with him than he is with her. It's not that simple for Maddie. She has a jealous ex-husband to deal with ... a feisty, resentful teenager ... a widowed mother unable to emerge from mourning ... and the ongoing heartbreak of her father's unsolved murder. Is it possible to throw all of that aside for the chance to be happy?

Safe Harbor,"In her fifty-ninth bestselling novel, Danielle Steel tells an unforgettable story of survival...of how two people who lost everything find hope...and of the extraordinary acts of faith and courage that bring —and keep— families together... On a windswept summer day, as the fog rolls across the San Francisco coastline, a solitary figure walks down the beach, a dog at her side. At eleven, Pip Mackenzie's young life has already been touched by tragedy; nine months before, a terrible accident plunged her mother into inconsolable grief. But on this chilly July afternoon, Pip meets someone who fills her sad gray world with color and light. And in her innocence and in his kindness, a spark will be kindled, lives will be changed, and a journey of hope will begin. From the moment the curly-haired girl walks up to his easel on the sand, Matt Bowles senses something magical about her. Pip reminds him of his own daughter at that age, before a bitter divorce tore his family apart and swept his children halfway across the world. With her own mother, Ophélie, retreating deeper into her grief, Pip spends her summer at the shore the way lonely children do: watching the glittering waters and rushing clouds, daydreaming and remembering how things used to be. That is, until she meets artist Matt Bowles, who offers to teach the girl to draw—and can't help but notice her beautiful, lonely mother. At first, Ophélie is thrown off balance by her daughter's new companion—until she realizes how much joy he is bringing into their lives, despite the sadness she sees in his eyes. As their newfound friend works his subtle magic, mother and daughter slowly begin to heal, to laugh again, to rediscover what they have lost. When summer ends, and Ophélie and Pip must leave the beach for the city, the season of healing continues. Gathering her newfound strength, Ophélie begins a volunteer job at a city outreach program, where she works with the homeless, and can no longer ignore the blessings in her own life. But as soul-sharing phone calls and autumn beach getaways deepen Ophélie and Matt's friendship, fate strikes another blow. Out of the blue, Matt must confront unfinished business from his past. Days later, Ophélie is struck by a stunning betrayal by someone she trusts. And as these events reverberate in two already wounded hearts, something extraordinary happens. Out of the darkness that has shadowed them both comes an unexpected gift of hope. With grace and compassion, Danielle Steel explores the fragile bonds between mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, family members and lifelong friends. Her haunting, impassioned novel takes us across the complex landscape of loss—to the blessings that arise from even the darkest tragedies. At once a story of triumph and a moving elegy to those who suffer and survive, Safe Harbour is perhaps her most powerful and life-affirming novel to date.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OMR4YoLKu5gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2009,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OMR4YoLKu5gC&source=gbs_api,0,94,54,1

But it's Sylvie's French, vaguely famous name on Rebecca's creatively embellished resume that lands her an associate editor position at romance heavyweight Candlelight Books.

Even the support of her outrageous best friend Thora—to whom Bonnie tells everything—can’ t help fill the emptiness inside her. Then Naz finds a blanketed infant on the banks of Canaan Creek, and suddenly Bonnie’s life is transformed. She has found her calling.

Small Gods,"'You should do things because they're right. Not because gods say so. They might say something different another time.' Religion is a competitive business in the Discworld.

So when the great god Om accidentally manifests himself as a lowly tortoise, stripped of all divine power, it's clear he's become less important than he realised. In such instances, you need an acolyte, and fast. Enter Brutha, the Chosen One - or at least the only One available.

Water of Death,"Kenzaburo Oe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for creating ""an imagined world, where life and myth condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human predicament today."" In Death by Water, his recurring protagonist and literary alter-ego returns to his hometown village in search of a red suitcase fabled to hold documents revealing the details of his father’s death during WWII: details that will serve as the foundation for his new, and final, novel. Since his youth, renowned novelist Kogito Choko planned to fictionalize his father’s fatal drowning in order to fully process the loss. Stricken with guilt and regret over his failure to rescue his father, Choko has long been driven to discover why his father was boating on the river in a torrential storm. Though he remembers overhearing his father and a group of soldiers discussing an insurgent scheme to stage a suicide attack on Emperor Mikado, Choko cannot separate his memories from imagination and his family is hesitant to reveal the entire story. When the contents of the trunk turn out to offer little clarity, Choko abandons the novel in creative despair. Floundering as an artist, he’s haunted by fear that he may never write his tour de force. But when he collaborates with an avant-garde theater troupe dramatizing his early novels, Kogito is revitalized by revisiting his formative work and he finds the will to continue investigating his father’s demise. Diving into the turbulent depths of legacy and mortality, Death by Water is an exquisite examination of resurfacing national and personal trauma, and the ways that storytelling can mend political, social, and familial rifts.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nkpkCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2015,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nkpkCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,0,245,79,6
How Green Was My Valley,"The international bestselling winner of the National Book Award and the basis for the Academy Award Best Picture film directed by John Ford. Huw Morgan remembers the days when his home valley was prosperous, verdant, and beautiful—before the mines came to town. The youngest son of a respectable mining family in South Wales, he is now the only one left in the valley, and his reminiscences tell the story of a family and a town both defined and ruined by the mines. Huw’s story is both joyful and heartrending—a portrait of a place and a people existing now only in memory. Full of memorable characters, richly crafted language, and surprising humor, How Green Was My Valley is the first of four books chronicling Huw’s life, including the sequels Up into the Singing Mountain, Down Where the Moon is Small, and Green, Green My Valley Now. “The reader emerges from these tense pages strangely aglow with sharing the happiness of the characters . . . The simplicity of the language and its delicately strange flavor give the book added charm.” —Chicago Tribune",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eU4qAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2013,http://books.google.nl/books?id=eU4qAAAAQBAJ&dq=How+Green+Was+My+Valley&hl=&source=gbs_api,0,354,164,6

He's a lucky man: healthy and handsome, with two beautiful women ready to spend the rest of their lives with him and an enormously successful career that gets more promising by the minute.

Hard as he tries to forget what he saw, this disturbing sign is only the first of many Jonah will witness, and before long his life is unrecognizable.

The Story of Ruth,"PEN/Hemingway Award Winner: An “enthralling” novel of a woman trapped within a tragically dysfunctional family (Entertainment Weekly). From the New York Times–bestselling author of The Excellent Lombards and A Map of the World, this is “an extraordinary story of a family’s disintegration [that] will be compared to Jane Smiley’s A Thousand Acres” (People). It follows Ruth Grey, a young woman in a tiny Illinois farm town, who has lost her father to World War II, and constantly faces her unhappy mother’s wrath—when she isn’t being ignored in favor of her math-prodigy brother. As Ruth navigates her lonely life, she strives to find happiness and pleasure where she can, but the world may conspire to defeat her. “A sly and wistful, if harrowing, human comedy . . . [An] original voice in fiction and one well worth listening to.” —The Boston Sunday Globe “Unforgettably, beat by beat, Hamilton maps the best and worst of the human heart and all the mysterious, uncharted country in between.” —Kirkus Reviews “Hamilton’s story builds to a shocking crescendo. Her small-town characters are as appealingly offbeat and brushed with grace as any found in Alice Hoffman’s or Anne Tyler’s novels.” —Glamour",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qp7iBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2014,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qp7iBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,0,183,80,6
"McDonough,: A novel","“A warm, heartfelt novel about what it means to belong to a family.

Her grandson, PJ, and his new wife, Alexis, live in a charming cottage behind the main house.

Megan sees the strained relationship between her husband and Mary Bernadette, who has never quite recovered from the loss of her first-born son. Megan, too, is torn between gaining her mother-in-law's approval and living life on her own terms. Alexis loves PJ deeply yet chafes against his grandmother's influence in their marriage. But when a looming scandal brings unexpected tragedy, the Fitzgibbons are compelled to determine the depth of their loyalty, find their strength--and repair the bonds that have held a town, and a family, together for so long.
