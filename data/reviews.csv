The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels),Harriet Klausner,5,"While floating in the water near San Diego, research scientist Kalista Jordan contemplates what she can do next to get ahead in her profession. The intelligent African-American physicist knows all the angles and is setting in motion her plan to replace her boss Dr. David Crone. However, she runs into her apartment when she hears a frightening noise only to have someone choke her to death.Attorney Paul Madriani feels frustrated as his stubborn client David, on trial for Kalista's murder, refuses to cooperate in his own defense. Wondering if he represents a guilty person, Paul concludes that he will do his job in spite of his brilliant clients' efforts to stubbornly block him and try to win an acquittal from the jury.THE JURY reads like a modernized and updated Stanley Erle Gardner Perry Mason legal thriller. The novel treats the readers to a daily account of the trial and when court is not in session readers get an insider's look into hard to enter legal circles. The story line is very vivid, especially when Steve Martini describes the courtroom scenes. They feel so authentic the audience will feel they sit in the docket. Clearly, this novel is in the running for best legal procedural of the year, sending readers seeking running for more Martinis.Harriet Klausner"
Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy),Harriet Klausner,5,"In Pleasant valley, Pennsylvania, three women were invited to attend a cocktail party hosted at a castle by people they never met before. Intrigued each one shows up as well as three men. The women learn they are the chosen to rescue the stolen souls of the three ""daughters of glass"". Each one will seek a special key that will open the locks that imprison Ninkane, Venora, and Kyna. Others have tried and failed as the God Kane is powerful, tricky, and willing to kill his antagonists.Last month Malory Price was first up and successfully found the KEY OF LIGHT. She also fell in love with one of the trio of men accompanying the hunt. Now librarian Dana Steele draws the short straw and begins her quest for the KEY OF KNOWLEDGE. She has one month to succeed or the entire mission fails. Though she knows that at some point she will go it alone, her allies help her, but especially Jordan Hawke. She loved him once, but he left her without a look back. Jordan is willing die to keep his beloved safe. Kane is willing to accommodate Jordan, but killing Dana is an option.The key to a Nora Roberts novel is the believability of the characters who, regardless of the situation (even a fantasy setting), seem genuine. That is the case in KEY OF KNOWLEDGE as it was with its predecessor and guaranteed to occur with the conclusion (see KEY OF VALOR). The story line is exciting, but it is the prime players regardless of ""species"" that make this tale and the series a must delight for fans of romantic fantasy.Harriet Klausner"
Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy),A Customer,1,This was my least favorite book in a poorly written series. The plot went around in circles and it felt like nothing was being accomplished. I enjoy Nora Roberts' books but I really did not like this series and I would not recommend it to anyone.
Lover's Talisman,CoffeeGurl,4,"This book broke the reading rut I've had for a couple of days. Lover's Talisman is an erotic and paranormal delight. The story and the leading characters will hook you in and won't let go until its final page. Welcome to Talisman Bay -- where things go bump in the night and where love comes along in the most unexpected ways. The Shadow Walkers consist of a secret group of five mortal men who protect people from demons, vampires, werewolves and other monsters. Stephan Rashleigh is one of those men. He has dedicated his life to protecting innocent bystanders against creepy crawlies and has given up on the idea of ever finding love. That is until he meets Mariah, an exotic dancer with a tumultuous romantic past. His life is never the same after he saves her life from a mating demon. Then he decides to continue to protect her after her best friend is kidnaped by werewolves. He knows that he is the reason why she is danger, and dreads the thought of giving up on the only woman he has ever loved. There are various twists throughout the novel.This novel has a dark edge that comes from the paranormal aspect of the story. I liked the world of Talisman Bay and the sort of noble heroes the Walkers represented. However, I would have liked for the novel to concentrate more on the monsters -- namely the vampires, werewolves and different kinds of demons -- and less on the sexual tension between Stephan and Mariah. I found it unrealistic that Mariah delved on her sexual attraction for Stephan after she had encountered a supernatural creature for the first time. Not that I didn't enjoy the sexual tension and subsequent sex scenes between the protagonists. The scenes were amazingly hot. And I liked that the leading characters were well developed, even if the other Shadow Walkers were not as well developed. But this is an outstanding series and I look forward to getting to know all of the characters. Aside from a few inconsistencies, Talisman Bay is a steamy, action-packed, entertaining novel. I highly recommend it. I look forward to reading the second part of the series."
The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files),Harriet Klausner,5,"""The Atrocity Archive"". .The mission of the ultra top secret British espionage agency the Laundry is to defend the crown against occult attacks. The agency employs a variety of employees, but perhaps at the lowest rung is Bob, a computer repairman. However, Bob stops what could have been a nasty incident occurring during a demonstration. His reward is a leap into the cold to save the world from devastation from beyond that plans to snack on the universe once this essence pierces the once thought of impregnable barrier.""The Concrete Jungle"". The country starting with the Laundry is in trouble as some big shot plans to change agents into zombies so that he can take over the country and ultimately the world. Only Agent Bob and local police officer Josephine stand in the way of stopping the zombie attack, but first he must explain why he failed to follow standard operating procedures when he called for backup during a deadly confrontation in which he failed to fill out the proper form and going through the chain of command. Saving the world does not stop a written reprimand and counseling as follow the rules not logic prevails.Taking Get Smart into a technological paranormal world is what the novel (The Atrocity Archives) and the novella (The Concrete Jungle) is all about as Bob battles supernatural combatants and the bureaucracy with differing but always humorous results. Both tales are satirical fun as the espionage thriller goes through the rinse cycle as only officious government regulations would expect. Charles Stross writes a wild zany pair of occult spy escapades.Harriet Klausner"
A JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH,A Customer,4,this is an ok book really interesting but a lot of hard words. You should have dictionary next to you or look it up on your'e kindle just like me.
Beyond the Shadows,Harriet Klausner,5,"In 1955, Deborah Haskins receives grieving sympathy from her parents and her beloved Andy's parents at his funeral. All she could think of is that it is not fair, as the two should have grown old together on their farm together. However, the Korean War cut short the life of the pious Sunday school teacher Andy; Deborah feels fifteen months seems unfairly and excessively short.A few months after the funeral veteran Gideon Clermont, who served with Andy in Korea and attended the funeral, arrives at the farm to offer help to the widow. Andy was his best friend and saved his life. Not long afterward, surprising everyone who knows her and her love for Andy, Deborah and Gideon marry. However, Gideon is a gentle alcoholic who believes he pales next to the angelic aura of Deborah instead of the deeply religious Andy. This marriage seemingly in haste appears doomed unless they reach out to one another and the Lord with understanding that there is ""a reason for every purpose under heaven"".Deborah is the key to this wonderful inspirational character study as she feels somewhat like a female Job tested with the death of her first husband and the alcoholism of her second spouse. Gideon is a more complex person as he concludes that he is a shadow compared to Andy's light and ironically as a carpenter to Jesus. Alcohol is his only way to escape BEYOND THE SHADOWS that engulfs him unless they turn to the Lord. Robin Lee Hatcher furbishes an intriguing historical Christian drama that readers of the sub-genre will highly value as entertainment and more significantly as encouragement.Harriet Klausner"
Being Committed : A Novel,CoffeeGurl,4,"Anna Maxted is one of my favorite Brit-chick-lit authors. I loved Getting Over It and Behaving Like Adults and looked forward to reading Being Committed. Hannah is a thirty-something private investigator with commitment issues. Jason, her boyfriend of five years, proposes marriage and she says no. When she discovers that he is engaged to another woman just a few weeks after breaking up with her, she tries to get back with him. He accepts, but under one condition: that she attends therapy sessions with him and seeks closure with her ex-husband Jack. As Hannah tries to figure out her feelings for Jack and Jason, she discovers many things about herself and about secrets behind the marriage and infidelities between her mother and her father. There are various fun twists throughout the novel.Again, Maxted creates a fun story that has quite some poignant storylines that make her novel have more depth than the average chick-lit. The author has always mixed dark issues with lighthearted language, making the novel entertaining as well as thought-provoking. In here, Maxted does a deep study of romantic relationships and commitment issues. The lines are full of wit and insight. My favorite passage is: ""There are certain men who need to get married, for whom the woman is almost incidental to proceedings. The woman is the tedious yet necessary ingredient, similar to yeast in bread. This sort of man fixes on his target rather like a pit bull, and any girl who can't run fast enough is at risk."" Witty remarks such as this one occur throughout the novel. I love Hannah's dry humor. The part where she talks about waxing, er, certain embarrassing parts is hilarious! I laughed aloud many times, sometimes in public, much to other people's puzzlement. This is a novel that will make you laugh, nod in agreement with Hanna's musings and move you with the poignant developments. Anna Maxted has quite a unique voice and I recommend this gem."
"Tempting Danger (The World of the Lupi, Book 1)",Harriet Klausner,5,"San Diego Police Detective Lily Yu sees the mangled corpse of a big victim who seemed to know how to defend himself, but was ripped apart anyway. She realizes that this is no ordinary killer. Evidence points towards the Nokolai werewolf clan's Prince Rule Turner.When someone viciously assaults his father, the clan leader, Rule concludes he can no longer let the officials investigate the murders that make him the prime suspect. He is fortunate that the lead police investigator is not only open-minded, but smells a frame. Lily and Rule team up to try to stop a Lupi serial killer from murdering more innocent people, but neither realized that their partner is their lifemate though both feel the attraction from the start.Talk about living dangerously, Eileen Wilks takes her novella ""Only Human"" from the terrific paranormal romance anthology LOVER BEWARE and lengthens it into a fantastic full length novel. The story line contains all the excitement and more as readers gain a greater understanding of the werewolf species and insight into the lead couple. Lily and Rule are a fabulous pairing who must first weed out a rogue killer before they can explore their feelings. Ms. Wilks takes a chance and readers are the winners.Harriet Klausner"
An Infamous Army,CoffeeGurl,5,"Spring and summer, 1815. It has been reported that Napoleon Bonaparte has left the isle of Elba and is marching down to France from the north. The Duke of Wellington and other commanders are gathering their armies to prepare for any potential attack, though most people think it will lead to nothing. The Duke describes his troops as an ""infamous Army, very weak, and ill-equipped, and a very inexperienced staff."" You can cut the tension with a knife. As Europe prepares for battle, Colonel Charles Audley, during his stay in Brussels, falls for Lady Barbara Childe, a beautiful widow with a questionable reputation. She is a flirt, has broken many hearts, which is why everyone is shocked when she accepts the colonel's marriage proposal. Audley is a penniless soldier, and everyone thought that she would go for a wealthy gentleman. As the Battle of Waterloo looms and the people begin to flee the premises, the lady and her brave colonel embark upon a journey of self-discovery all their own...I read this book about the same time as I reread Jane Austen's Emma, and I must say that it is difficult to pinpoint which one of the two I enjoyed reading the most. This is one of the best historical novels I have read in a very long time. Georgette Heyer describes Waterloo in such a way that you feel like you are there. She even describes the passage that Bonaparte takes in his effort to invade France. There is a main romantic plot centered on Lady Barbara and the Colonel, but the chapters that concentrate on the Duke of Wellington and the political affairs are much more fascinating. Put together, however, makes for a fascinating read. Georgette Heyer doesn't get enough credit for her novels. She -- like English contemporaries Daphne du Maurier, Mary Stewart and Anya Seton -- don't get the sort of praise that older novelists like Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte get. Yet they deserve it, including Heyer, whose work includes some funny Regency romances, some of which I've read, but had also written intelligent historical fiction and dark mysteries. An Infamous Army, first published in 1937, is the perfect novel for those who love the Napoleonic era. Cannot recommend this enough!"
Mad Dog and Englishman: A Mad Dog & Englishman Mystery (Mad Dog & Englishman Series),Harriet Klausner,4,"For the most part, the citizens of Buffalo Springs, Kansas are law abiding. It has been seventeen years since the last homicide. The sheriff's brother, who is one-fourth Cheyenne, dresses up as an Indian. He goes to the local park seeking a vision, but instead stumbles over the mutilated corpse of Reverend Peter Samms.The deputy chases after an outsider, a black man who the law enforcement official believes killed the Reverend. During the pursuit, the deputy wrecks the car. Next, police officials find the Reverend's father dead with his head scalped in the same way as his son. These two murders are linked to the kidnapping of the sheriff's daughter by two dysfunctional adults. The sheriff needs to outwit the psychotic duo while outrunning a tornado.MAD DOG AND ENGLISHMAN does not contain Cocker or Russell, but remains a fascinating, unusual police procedural due to the cast. The ensemble seems to have just stepped out of the Twilight Zone or perhaps Eerie, Indiana. Thus, the plot and characters make for an uncanny tale that J.M. Hayes could turn into a series that serves as the exciting center of weirdness in the mystery universe.Harriet Klausner"
Gaudy Night,Harriet Klausner,5,"Mystery writer Harriet Vane returns to Oxford's Shrewsbury College for a class reunion knowing her recent trial for murder makes her infamous. Since her acquittal Harriet says no to her persistent hero Lord Peter Wimsey while feeling somewhat abashed that her dirty laundry was revealed in court but as she did even in jail and at the trial she still refuses to bow down to the nasty gossips.However, someone has a different opinion about Harriet. She receives ugly letters calling her a ""dirty murderess;"" each one harsher than the previous. Fearing for her life, she asks her champion Lord Peter for help as she knows a stalker walking the hallow halls of Oxford plans to execute her.The third Lord Peter Wimsey Mystery with Harriet Vane (see Have His Carcase and Strong Poison) is an engaging historical mystery that focuses on the beginning of the Depression and the bantering relationship between the protagonists more than the super whodunit. The support cast is excellent as they bring circa 1930s academia to life while making a strong case for women's rights as the female professors have less standing than male freshmen. Fast-paced, fans will enjoy the engaging Gaudy Night.Harriet Klausner"
The Covenant Rising: Book One of The Dreamtime,Harriet Klausner,5,"Bhealfa is a caste society in which magic defines status. Authorities use spells to keep the masses in line and watch everyone through all-seeing scythe bowls. While the eccentric Prince Melyobar and his retinue sail in his movable dwelling to avoid Death, the Gath Tampoor Empire uses the Bhealfa citizenry as it has for twenty years as sword and sorcery fodder in its war with the Rintarah Empire, the previous conquerors and wasters of Bhealfa populace.Reeth Caldason seeks magical relief from the curse he suffers from that turns him into a blood raging mass killer if not chained, but learns the wizard he seeks is dead. The wizard's apprentice Kutch Pirathon mentions the Covenant, which gives the beleaguered Reeth a sliver of hope. Another visitor Dulian Karr, paying respect to the deceased, wants to liberate Bhealfa from the two empires that rotate subjugation; he suggests that Kutch and Reeth team up as they seek the same requirement, a master mage. The epic adventure for freedom has begun.In many ways THE COVENANT RISING is a typical epic fantasy, but is also much more. The story line contains the usual sword and sorcery elements throughout, but Stan Nicholls blends them into an intriguing societal arrangement sort of like India's caste society within a magically based Orwellian 1984. Reeth and Kutch are terrific protagonists with neither trusting the other though needing one another if they are to gain their wish. The freeing of incarcerated female military captain Serrah Ardacris, whose imprisonment adds to the feel of a real society, increases the unease of the ""alliance"" between this dynamic dual. Thought provoking, Mr. Nicholls furbishes a terrific opening tale in his Dreamtime trilogy.Harriet Klausner"
Half In Love - Stories,CoffeeGurl,5,"I loved this wonderful collection of short stories, most of which have a western setting. Half in Love deals with various aspects of the human condition, like infidelity, grief, growing pains and other issues. The stories set in ranches are the best ones here, in my opinion. My favorite stories are ""Four Lean Hounds, ca. 1976,"" ""A Stakes Horse,"" ""The River,"" ""Ranch Girl,"" and ""Red."" The aforementioned ones are my favorites, but all fifteen stories fulfilled and enthralled me from beginning to end and I cannot wait to read another wonderful, thought-provoking offering by Maile Meloy."
4 Blondes,CoffeeGurl,3,"I enjoyed Candace Bushnell's Sex and the City. I also love her column in the New York Observer, but her new book, Four Blondes, lacks charm and originality. I felt as though I was reading one of her newspaper articles. She brought absolutely nothing new in this one. That's not to say, however, that it isn't a fun and interesting read. I really enjoyed the story of Janey WIlcox. I have met my fair share of gold diggers and she is a very spunky character. The other stories were okay, but they seemed awfully familiar. Bushnell is incredibly talented. She talks about sex, money and lavish lifestyles with a great deal of knowledge and soul. I just wish she'd write something with fewer cliches."
Midnight Embrace,Harriet Klausner,4,"Analisa Mathews knows that it is just a matter of a short time before she joins her family in death. The disease has left her weak and the ailing woman welcomes her demise until the strange doctor visits her and gives her a concoction. Her regular physician Dr. Martinson is shocked to see Analisa begin to recover her health. To Analisa's surprise Martinson cannot even see her enigmatic medical visitor that she observes in plain sight.After leaving the hospital fully and miraculously recovered, Analisa learns the identity of her benefactor, Lord Alesandro de Avallone. She moves into his castle based on his note that she is welcome there while he is away. Analisa soon perceives the true identity of her benevolent host and falls in love with him in spite of knowing he is a vampire. He returns her feelings, but has placed her in danger from a deadly enemy.Though the good vs. evil is over-pronounced, fans of vampire romances will want to read MIDNIGHT EMBRACE. The story line contains two wonderful lead protagonists and an enlightening support cast especially Alesandro's servants that enable the audience to better understand the era and the starring duet. Amanda Ashley provides her fans with an enticing supernatural love story.Harriet Klausner"
Annie Get Your Guy/ Messing Around with Max,Harriet Klausner,5,"&quot;Annie Get Your Guy.&quot; Annie Sawyer knows her bookstore is a success, but when it comes to luring a blockhead like Guy Donovan she is a failure. He treats little Annie like a younger tomboyish brother. With the encouragement of her sister-in-law, Annie plans to seduce Guy. Either he will die of a heart attack from laughing at her, lose all respect for her, or match the beat of her heart. The only problem is that Guy plans to marry someone else.&quot;Messing Around With Max.&quot; Annie's brother Max meets one of her regulars Maddie Montgomery at the bookstore. Her show of affection towards his mean-spirited but harmless dog Cleo stuns him. He goes into near cardiac arrest when she chooses him to teach her everything she wants to know about sex. However, though Cleo accepts Maddie, Max wonders how to persuade Maddie that though he may be a reprobate, she is his destiny.Writing for Duets has to be one of the more frightening assignments for an author because readers obviously compare the two tales. Writing two novels for the same Duet has to be even scarier because the audience can contrast your own work and find one lacking substance which means there is damage to one's reputation. Based on her works in DUETS 47, Lori Foster shows she has the talent to handle double duty, as her two Sawyer tales are fun and amusing with likable lead characters. No messing around, Ms Foster gets her fans with a pair of fabulous romantic romps that provide delightful entertainment.Harriet Klausner"
Beautiful Lies: A Novel,CoffeeGurl,3,"Ridley Jones is a successful thirty-something freelance journalist from New York. Her life is normal until the day she rescues a child and her picture is all over the news. She receives a letter with a picture of three people -- a man, a woman and a child -- that says, ""Are you my daughter?"" From then on, her life isn't the same. Her parents, or the people she once believed were her parents, are obviously hiding something. Her junkie brother, Ace, resents her and someone wants her dead. There is a mystery surrounding an organization put together by her uncle involving the help of children in troubled homes. On top of everything else, an attractive and mysterious man named Jake steps into her life just as she begins to question everything around her. Who is Ridley? What is in her past and who is trying to keep her from finding out? There are various twists throughout the novel.I like the buildup of tension and suspense in this. You get the answers in a timely but fast-paced fashion and you can't wait to know what happens next. The heroine has a great voice. I love the way the author describes New York. She doesn't romanticize the city -- makes it as dark as the plot of this novel. The story is kind of complex and you're confused for a while, but the author puts its pieces together nicely. There are areas in which the plot and narrative become annoying. For instance, there is a scene where Ridley demands the truth from one of the characters, but she keeps pushing the character away or interrupting him or picking fights. I almost threw the book across the wall and yelled, ""Just let the man talk!"" Ugh. Other than that, this is an enjoyable and suspenseful effort. Lisa Unger is a great writer and I recommend Beautiful Lies."
Beautiful Lies: A Novel,A Customer,3,"When I staerted reading this book I really couldnt put it down. It has all the ingredients for a page turner. Why the 3 stars you ask? That's one reason. She is conatantly asking the reader questions and making &#34;asides&#34; I enjoy being a bystander not a participant. I also noticed how the main character was inconsistant, smart at getting some things and slow at other times. The way the author wrote was that you really wernt too far ahead of wat the characters knew, however, when Ridley or Jake made their apiphanies found myself saying &#34;yeah no crap ( no $?*!) I already knew this&#34;The book is an easy read and is a good mystery type book. I would have payed more for the book as for the most part enjoyed the read."
The Essential Charlotte,Harriet Klausner,4,"Thirty something Manhattanite Charlotte Stiles cannot believe that Corrine (her mother insisted she call by her name) just died. The ""Ask the Doctor"" research librarian is a bit off but not just because of the death of the only person who loved her (albeit from a distance). It is hard to believe because Corrine was filled with vigor and &eacute;lan traveling the globe as a nutty but likable artist.The will shakes Charlotte to the core because Corrine's stipulation for her daughter to inherit her Soho loft, she must live there for one year with her father, whom she thought died over three decades ago. Charlotte cannot even look at him so how is she to live with William LaViolette for one year. One thing is for sure it is not by seeing a hunk of an actor. Her only help lives in San Francisco, but Paul is there for her encouraging her as they talk over the Net; that is not counting her chats with mom.When the tale concentrates on a deep character study of what is THE ESSENTIAL CHARLOTTE, the story line is superb; when the subplot dips into chick lit turf it remains fun but typical candy fare. Overall Libby Schmais keeps her novel at the highest quality levels as readers become acquainted with Charlotte through her activities, discussions with her deceased mom, and the three males (dad, the actor, and Paul) currently in her life. Fans of powerful character-driven dramas will want to read the near perfect tale of how Charlotte finds her groove.Harriet Klausner"
The Essential Charlotte,CoffeeGurl,4,"I read The Perfect Elizabeth some years ago and thought I'd give Libby Schmais another whirl. The Essential Charlotte, like The Perfect Elizabeth, is another enchanting novel about getting to know a significant other in your life as well as oneself. Charlotte is a shy research librarian who lives on the edge by way of her eccentric mother, chic artist Corrine. But when her mother dies, Charlotte feels at a loss. The one good thing is that she'll inherit her mother's trendy Soho loft. But there is one condition: she has to live there with her father for one year. There is one problem: she doesn't know her father. In fact, she had no idea her father had been alive until after her mother died! How is she going to cope living with a stranger, even if he is her father? There are some twists throughout the novel.The Essential Charlotte is full of wit and charm. The backdrop of the art world as well as the obsession with New York real estate sets the perfect tone for this story. Charlotte is a great heroine and I was able to relate with her every day problems and inner musings. The novel sometimes drifted to the usual chick-lit, single-thirty-something-woman-living-in-New-York angst, but Schmais writes the aforementioned things with wit and insight and therefore making this novel unique. Her writing style is similar to the author Jennifer Weiner at times. I recommend The Essential Charlotte and I look forward to reading more stuff by this author."
Party Crashers,Harriet Klausner,4,"Realtor Jolie Goodman quit her job over her new boss demanding she do an unethical act in order to make a sale. Jolie temporarily sells shoes at the Nieman Marcus in Atlanta's Lenox Mall. There she meets Beck Underwood of Underwood Broadcasting, who needs socks and shoes having just returned from Central America. The duo is attracted to one another, but nothing comes of it not jus because she is working, but police Detective Salyers arrives to question Jolie about her missing boyfriend Gary Hagan, whose car was found in the Chattahoochee with a dead woman inside.The police suspect that Jolie abetted Gary in his escape though she denies involvement. As Detective Salyers searches for Gary, he quietly warns Jolie to watch herself as he is in danger and she might be. Meanwhile she runs into Beck at an event that she crashes and soon they begin to fall in love. However, after Gary, she has doubts about her taste in men besides which she is in danger from people who believe she has something of Gary's that they want at any cost.Though the police procedural-Gary subplot in many ways takes center stage and the conspiracy behind all this is overdone, the contemporary romance between Jolie and Beck is well written and cleverly interwoven with the case. The support cast adds depth especially those co-workers like the ultra-tall long necked professional party crasher who mentors the heroine in the arts of attending celebrity events for free. Fans will appreciate this mixing of humor and love within in a crime thriller while attending an advanced class in Party Crashing 301.Harriet Klausner"
Hard Times,A Customer,3,"I totally didn't get this book. Ordinarily I like Dickens but now I simply couldn't figure out what each event had to do with each other, nor did I understand the end. However the single segments, especially those with Louisa in them, were interesting. It is even funny reading the beginning of the book when Mr. Gradgrind teaches that imagination is useless and only facts are important. If you want a fluid book that is more this type of story,read Great Expectations,which is not my favorite book but it certainly makes more sense. Personally, my favorite Dickens is Oliver Twist."
The Way He Makes Me Feel,Harriet Klausner,5,"Electrician Duncan Hillston brags to his friends Hawk Morrissey and Patrick Morley that he made it with Hollywood star Janette Baxter who makes Halle look ugly. His friends have listened to him boast that he is the player since ninth grade, but this time they feel his hyperbole is outrageous. He insists he can pick up any woman through his time tested three step process of soothe them, entice them, and finally seduce them. They offer to pay for a Europe trip if he can get Claire ""Medusa"" Scott to fall in love with him by accompanying him to the Westfield annual block party in two weeks.Though he puts up a front, Duncan remembers Medusa as the brain of school, graduating with his class though three years younger. Her intelligence intimidated him then and he fears she still does. Unbeknownst to him, Claire had a crush on Duncan and never forgot him though he avoided her. As Duncan applies his scientific method to score, a strange thing happens; he falls in love with Claire, but though he believes she reciprocates, he fears how she will react when he mentions the wager something he believes he must tell her.THE WAY HE MAKES ME FEEL is an enjoyable contemporary romance starring a likable player who succeeds with the women (though at times exaggerates his prowess) because he treats females with respect. His counterpart Claire is a genius in the lab as a research pharmacist, but the little ninth grader resides inside her. Together, Duncan and Claire make for a fine reading experience for sub-genre fans.Harriet Klausner"
The Medici Dagger,Harriet Klausner,4,"In 1491, Leonardo da Vinci invents a new alloy. He shapes it into a blade and places it inside a vise. He slams a mallet on the tip only to see the hammer split apart while the dagger remains whole. Knowing how his benefactors think, Leonardo believes that his creation would be used as a weapon of destruction. He hides his findings with the hope that the future will beget a world filled with peace that can use his alloy for the common good.Five centuries later internationally recognized da Vinci expert Rollo Barnett decodes the Renaissance Man's enigmatic writing about the dagger. However, he and his wife die in a suspicious-looking fire. Two decades later, Rollo's son Reb learns that a billionaire arms dealer murdered his parents. He obsessively needs to complete his father's work on da Vinci and revenge himself on the killer though he places himself in danger from his parents' killer.If thriller fans suspend logic for a few hours, they will enjoy an action packed tale. The story line requires the reader to accept a lot even from the start. For instance, da Vinci hides his new discovery for fear of weapon-use yet shapes it into a dagger. The arms dealer wants to make outer space smart bombs (don't ask how), but kills the prime source of locating the alloy. This consistent inconsistency is bothersome for those fans that need to believe in an ""authentic"" feel to the events. However, Cameron West's debut novel provides entertainment for those readers who want a simple but wild ride.Harriet Klausner"
Better Off Dead (Casey Jones Mysteries #5),Harriet Klausner,5,"Tough and able to keep her head during a crisis, Durham, North Carolina private detective Casey Jones does not own an official sleuthing license because she did time. Minor problem to Casey as she still handles inquiries for clients. Helen Pugh was raped, tortured, and left to die, bur somehow she survived. Already suffering from an extreme case of agoraphobia, her attacker begins calling her saying he plans to finish the job.Helen thinks Duke University Professor David Brookhouse attacked her, but his high priced attorney persuaded the jury otherwise when the case went to trial. Casey goes undercover as a student in one of Brookhouse's classes to see what dirt she find on him, not yet realizing how her actions places herself and her loved ones in danger from a clever sociopath.BETTER OFF DEAD is an exciting thriller starring an intrepid heroine and a host of eccentric characters, which eases some of the tension from the non-stop action. Katy Munger is a bright star who keeps her readers' attention until the climax, an ending that is not as tidy as most genre books. Fans should read this marvelous novel.Harriet Klausner"
Hopscotch,Harriet Klausner,5,"Though supposed to be above politics, the Agency is embroiled in internal politics that reacts to external pressures from the White House and Congress. Thus, it is not surprising that his employers force long time out in the cold agent Miles Kendig to retire. A man used to living beyond the edge in which every breath could mean death, Miles finds middle age life in America boring as he misses the adrenalin rush that his field missions provided him.Several years pass. Miles is ready to get back in the game on his terms. This time he will be a rogue exposing the world espionage units to the public as unscrupulous dirty tricks in which murder or ruining someone is a way of life and collateral damage is acceptable as long as the mission is accomplished. Competing spy agencies form strange bedfellows with one quest: destroy Miles before he exposes them. Gleefully, Miles, a veteran of twenty-five years of field work, looks forward to the ultimate cat and mouse game, in which he tossed down the gauntlet.This is a terrific spy thriller that sort of reminded this reviewer more of the Bourne Identity (second movie) than the Mathau film Hopscotch. Though the novel is from the late 1960s early 1970s, the story line remains fresh because the Cold War is more of a backdrop except that d'entente existed when it is convenient for all parties to fight the common cause, a lone ranger. That intrepid individualism that is rare to see in a society filled with profiles and spin doctors is what makes Brian Garfield's thriller hold up as a fabulous espionage thriller.Harriet Klausner"
Barbarians Are Coming,Harriet Klausner,5,"Sterling Lung grew up in the back of his parents' Chinese laundry. His parents expected Sterling to attend medical school so he could become a doctor. When he rejected their choice to attend a culinary school, Sterling's parents felt he dishonored them.Now twenty-six, Sterling's goal in life is to become the All-American male. However, he will soon find his roots, love interest, and employer pulling at him from different directions. His parents have chosen his Chinese bride, but Sterling wants to make his own selection. He feels very strongly that he is not ready to marry. His girlfriend wants Sterling to commit to a more meaningful relationship, but he is not ready to do so since she is in Iowa studying dentistry. His employer wants him to cook genuine Chinese cuisine, but Sterling studied French cuisine. He will have to &quot;Americanize&quot; the genuine taste. If he honors the wishes of others, Sterling dishonors his own desires.THE BARBARIANS ARE COMING is an incredible tale that provides the audience insight into the discord confronting Chinese-Americans. Sterling is a wonderful protagonist, but it is the support cast that brings him to life. His parents' paradoxical philosophy towards their son is extremely interesting, as they want him to make it in America while remaining Chinese. This cacophony will remind readers of their descendants' struggle between the &quot;old country&quot; and the Americanization of the children. David Wong Louie shows a clever talent that uses wit to describe the inner desires and conflict of his characters.Harriet Klausner"
The President's Assassin,Harriet Klausner,5,"In exile to the CIA's Office of Special Projects, Army JAG Major Sean Drummond is escorted by FBI Agent Jennifer Margold to a Virginia crime scene where six corpses are located. Considering that the house is impenetrable with cameras and radar detectors outside and agents inside, no one knows how the killer breached the premises. That is no one until Sean explains the most likely method that led to the assassination of the White House Chief of Staff Terry Belknap, his wife, and their four secret service bodyguards. The message left behind is ""... the president will be history in the next two days"".Though he wants out because he knows what will hit the bureaucratic fan, Sean wonders if the mass murders are linked to the $100 million bounty offered for killing the president? Soon a Supreme Court Justice and the Republican National Committee chairman are killed too. Drummond concludes that a mole inside the inner circle of security is giving away information. He must remove the mole before he can stop the killing machine, but has only one day left.In his fifth appearance, Drummond is at his wisecracking best because he has the perfect straight man (make that woman) the tight Margold as his sidekick. Sean is stupendous as he cannot sit idly quiet even when it is his in his best interests while working for the civilians. The story line is terrific, perhaps the best of a strong series as Brian Haig provides a fabulous political investigative thriller that grips the audience from the moment Sean opens his mouth in the affluent Virginia suburbs and never slows down until he gets the final word in.Harriet Klausner"
To Love a Scottish Lord: Book Four of the Highland Lords,Harriet Klausner,5,"In 1782 Sea Captain Hamish MacRae returns to Scotland a beaten man after being away for years. He recently lost his ship, his crew, and the use of an arm. He plans to live what he feels is his miserable life as a hermit so he does not have see or sense the pity of others including his brothers.

As they begin to fall in love, Mary is accused of killing her spouse. Brendan has a reason to live starting with proving his beloved never killed anyone.TO LOVE A SCOTTISH LORD is a delightful historical romance that the sub-genre audience will read in one appreciative sitting due to an effective cast that makes readers believe they are on an island in the late eighteenth century. The story line is loaded with action, angst, and suspense. However, the lead couple and several support players turn Karen Ranney's latest tale into a fabulous experience.Harriet Klausner"
Follow the Stars Home,Harriet Klausner,5,"Lobsterman Tim McIntosh worked the New England coast. He loved his wife Dianne, but could not deal with the sickly child that was born to them. Instead, Tim abandoned his spouse and little Julia. She sufferers from illnesses that leave her physically and mentally dying from birth. Perhaps because he loves Dianne or just feels bad by his sibling's abandonment, Tim's brother Alan constantly is there for Dianne and Julia. Alan's actions add to the guilty feelings and shame that fill Tim's heart, but his soul cannot take the steps needed to reconcile with his beloved wife nor shower his child with the love she needs.As Dianne supports herself and Julia, she meets a troubled twelve-year old Amy Brook, who becomes a little sister to her. Amy helps Dianne fully understand what love is all about, but will Tim ever learn the same lesson before it is too late?FOLLOW THE STARS HOME focuses on the meaning of love and its capacity to meliorate many human frailties. Dianne, Tim, and Amy seem very real because their characters are fully developed. The audience will dislike what Tim did, but understand his actions and frustrations. Reader's empathy towards Julia will gush throughout the novel. This emotion on the part of the audience shows how talented Luanne Rice is in sensitizing her fans, though for most of the novel the audience &quot;sees&quot; the ailing child through the eyes of the other characters. Using Julia's thoughts as a climax leads to a feeling that this was a contrived closing but Ms. Rice reaches inside our very hearts and souls with an inspiring novel that reflects on how precious but fleeting is life.Harriet Klausner"
Wind in the Stone,Harriet Klausner,5,"The Valley has always been a blessed place touched by magic that leaves a serene, safe locale. That pleasant environment changes when the teaching Magi of the Place of Learning fails to comprehend the threat posed by the seemingly pathetic student, Irasmus. However, through trickery and theft, Irasmus soon becomes more powerful than his instructors and soon moves into the Tower in Styrmer. Irasmus has broken the convent of noninterference shared by all the magical forces to avoid a second deadly war.To enhance his powers, Irasmus insures that a Valley gal births a son for him. Irasmus raises the lad Fogar as his apprentice who will augment the evil sorcerer's strengths. Meanwhile, Irasmus tossed out Fogar's twin sister Falice, who is raised by the native Sasqua and the Wind as the hopeful counterbalance to her male relatives.America had not entered World War II when Andre Norton was already a highly regarded author. Now sixty years have gone by and the great writer shows she still is one of the shining lights in the fantasy genre. WIND IN THE STONE is a well written, entertaining, by the book (that is ""Norton's anthology"") tale that will please genre fans , especially those of this great talent. The characters are fully developed, but it's the non-human sentient beings that seem so genuine that turns this story into another triumphant tale by the lifetime achievement award winning wrier(SF and fantasy) Ms. Norton."
"Into the Storm (Troubleshooters, Book 10)",Harriet Klausner,4,"After a harrowing experience in Afghanistan in which the visit of the Defense Secretary makes air support limited at best, SEAL Team Sixteen arrives home for some R&R.; However, Admiral Tucker figures the best rest for this elite group is a competition against a worthy opponent: private sector counterterrorist experts Troubleshooters, Inc, whose CEO is Tom Paoletti, former commanding officer of Team Sixteen. To add to the fun, the exercise occurs in December in the mountains of New Hampshire. Petty Officer Mark Jenkins and Troubleshooters operative Lindsey Fontaine are the liaisons between the teams.However, almost from the start in the frozen granite state troubles occurs as someone apparently kidnaps Tracy Shapiro, the Troubleshooters' new receptionist. No clue to her whereabouts surface and both squads fear for her life as she is no survivalist. However, as they keep searching, the two teams begin to uncover brutally tortured female corpses buried under the ice. A serial killer personally has modified the state motto to live free and kill.The opening Afghan sequence is some of the most realistic written military scene in recent years as Team Sixteen struggle to survive with little hope of support because politics is visiting Kabul. Once stateside, the story line is at its best with the contest and the growing loving relationship between the liaisons. The serial killer story line is fast-paced with women in the forefront, but also but also is a let down that takes away from the fascination of the competition. Still this is a fun thriller in which readers will say let the games begin.Harriet Klausner"
Journey to the Center of the Earth,A Customer,5,"I read this book a couple of years ago and I liked it. Though it starts off a little slow, it presented a good story."
Glimpses of Paradise: A Novel,Harriet Klausner,5,"In Nebraska, teenager Zee Miller, a minister's daughter, looks forward to leaving town for Hollywood stardom though her parents object to her dreams. Her friend Doyle Lawrence is being pressured by his wealthy father to follow in his footsteps by studying law though the lad has doubts.

The story line is action-packed yet driven by Doyle and Zee. Readers will understand his disillusionment with everything until Molly comes along. Zee also loses her idealism as she is grinded by the Hollywood beat. Yet through all this darkness, a light of hope begins to twinkle as James Scott Bell provides a fine 1920s tale that feels so relevant today.Harriet Klausner"
One Hundred Years of Solitude,CoffeeGurl,5,"This is one of the best pieces of literature ever written. In my opinion, Marquez's work is right up the alley of D. Foster Wallace and Gustave Flaubert. In One Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez tells the story of the Buendia family -- a family who has struggled the sometimes mundane and unjust world they live in for many generations. The descriptions are lurid and gruesome -- the suicide details, battles with insomnia, etc. -- a story told without reservations. However, One Hundred Years of Solitude is also a poignant and touching novel about the memorable Buendia family. This is a true and profound piece of literature written by a brilliant writer. This gem should be read more than once."
One Hundred Years of Solitude,A Customer,3,"Who is experiencing 100 years of solitude? The people who march off into the jungle and establish the village of Macondo, a town isolated for 100 years until its destruction. These people include 6 generations of the Buendia family. We meet pioneer Jose Arcadio Buendia who leads his people to the spot, and Colonel Aureliano Buendia who leads a left wing revolution in the outer world. We also meet a number of other Buendias named Jose Arcadio and Aureliano.The women are remarkable. Pioneer wife Ursula lives a supernaturally long life, from the superstitious wife of Jose Arcadio who fears that her children will be born with tails, to the Biblically old lady who is treated like a toy by the little children of the house.The book's biggest drawback for me is its sprawling confusion. Michener has done cross-generational books like Hawaii that are direct, serious, sensible. Where Michener's work could be compared to a lifelike painter like Titian, Marquez is more of a Picasso."
An Experiment in Treason,Harriet Klausner,5,"He may be blind but Sir John Fielding is regarded as one of the most intelligent magistrates in 1793 London. He presides as a judge in court and leads investigations on matters that are sensitive to England's interests. Lord Hillsborough, the Secretary of State for the American Colonies, is robbed and one of the footmen is dead. He tells Sir John that he has no idea what the burglars were after but the magistrate doesn't believe him.After he reports to his superior, Sir John is ordered to once again visit Lord Hillsborough who promises to be forthcoming. He says a packet of letters were stolen but he won't say how many or what was in them. Sir John's assistant, Jeremy traces the purloined letters to Ben Franklin and his confederate Arthur Lee. The latter is seen boarding a ship heading to the colonies and Jeremy presumes the letters are on board. Sir John is really not interested in the politics but he is interested in justice and will do all in his power to see the killer go to jail no matter who it is.It is fascinating to read about the English perspective on the troublesome English colonies and how far radicals will go in support of their solution. Bruce Alexander is a fine storyteller and the historical detail he brings to the plot only enhances the quality of AN EXPERIMENT IN TREASON. Readers will continue to read the Sir John Fielding mysteries because they are excellent period pieces.Harriet Klausner"
Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series),Harriet Klausner,5,"When the colonists landed on Pern, they didn't know that the red star would align with the planet every two hundred and fifty years. When that event happens, spores from the red star fall onto Pern destroying anything organic in its path. To combat this problem, geneticists changed fire lizards into telepathic dragons that bond with a human; together they unite to fight spores or thread as it is now called in 507 years after the initial landing of the spaceship.In AL 507, Lorana sends her fire lizards away when she thinks she is dying, but she is saved and brought to Bendon Weyr where she bonds with a hatchling dragonet Arith. A plague infects the dragons killing many including Arith just when thread is coming. Arith and Lorana's two fire lizards go back to 42 AL where geneticist Wind Blossom concludes that the three visitors come from Bendan Weyr in the future. She devises a plan to help her descendents battle the deadly dragon killer plague if the future people can interpret the clues she left behind to save them.This is the first solo Pern story not written by the immortal Anne McCaffrey, but her son who obviously inherited the writing gene as readers will not be able to tell who wrote the novel without reading the cover. Two women living centuries apart work to find a cure to save the dragons and ultimately their world. There is plenty of action scenes especially when dragons and their human rider battle thread, but it is the strong characterizations especially the grieving Lorana who can communicate with any dragon while reminded of the loss of her Arith to the plague that make this a worthy entry in the long running series.Harriet Klausner"
Mount Vernon Love Story: A Novel of George and Martha Washington,Harriet Klausner,5,"George Washington's father died when the future president was young. His mother was a harsh disciplinarian insuring George and his siblings behaved. George seemed to flee her whenever he could get away spending time at his half-brother's Mount Vernon home (yes - that historical home). George's first love is Sally Fairfax and his chosen profession surveyor, but war seemed to be his destiny. First he fought (unsuccessfully) during the French and Indian War and then the American Revolution.This biography uses Washington's retirement to Mount Vernon with his beloved Patsy (Martha's nickname) as a focal point for looking back over the lives of the first president and his spouse. The book concentrates on his personal life not his public life. Thus, readers see another side to Washington. Though opinions are interspersed throughout, mystery suspense thriller writer Mary Higgins Clark provides a strong insightful look at Washington and literally the first ""First Lady"" that historical readers will enjoy.Harriet Klausner"
A Man To Call My Own,Harriet Klausner,5,"On the train coming home from a Chicago business trip, Mortimer Laton fell between cars and died. Following the funeral in his hometown of Haverhill, Massachusetts, Mortimer's attorney Albert Bridges reads the will in which the preponderance of the estate went to his twin daughters equally. Worried about fortune hunters, Mortimer had one stipulation. To inherit, the girls must marry, but until they do his sister Kathleen will serve as their guardian and approve any groom. Amanda angrily leaves, but Marian understands that they will move to Texas to live with an unknown aunt.Chad Kinkaid works on Kathleen's ranch though he will inherit the neighboring spread. He is attracted immediately to Marian in spite of her dotty clothing and thick spectacles. She falls in love with Chad, but Marian believes he loves Amanda because no one ever cared about her. While Amanda falls in love with someone who seems indifferent to her and Chad has trouble persuading his beloved that they belong together, a behind the scenes manipulator has other plans for the Laton cash.Though there has been a rash of twins serving as protagonists lately, A MAN TO CALL MY OWN is an invigorating 1870s Texas romance. The plot contains an interesting major twist that will surprise the audience but also serve as a reminder of how far communication has come in under a century and a half. Though there is plenty of action, the story line focuses on the couples, more so on Marian and Chad, who readers will like. Johanna Lindsey provides an absorbing tale that her fans will appreciate.Harriet Klausner"
Amanda Bright@home,Harriet Klausner,4,"In Washington DC, thirty-five years old Amanda wonders if that is all there is in life.

Bob works for the Justice Department where he heading up an antitrust investigation against MegaByte.He is so engulfed in his work, Bob is clueless that Amanda is unhappy, depressed and perhaps nearing collapse. She cringes every time she sees her husband on the news as he has made something of himself while her degree serves as toilet paper. Amanda even dreams of returning to the NEA where she once was gainfully employed. Will Bob see the dual lights in the tunnel of the onrushing train in time to help Amanda before she suffers a breakdown and before he leads the Un-American attack on big business?Though married with children, AMANDA BRIGHT@HOME is a chick lit tale focusing on the woes of the lead female character. Readers will feel for Amanda when her depression seems overwhelming and she cannot breathe, but also wonder over how trivial the cause of the collapse seems. Still readers who believe that a family can save everyone within the unit will savor this tale. Pragmatists, centrists, and the left will prefer Dan Quayle for their family value treatise.Harriet Klausner"
Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed),CoffeeGurl,5,This novel is a true work of art. Memoirs of a Geisha drips with one of the most exquisite languages ever written. Arthur S. Golden's take on the Geisha culture before the Second World War is insightful and thought provoking. I couldn't put this book down. It had me from the opening of the first chapter! Various critics have complained that the author uses cliche descriptions to illustrate the Japanese government -- I couldn't disagree more! I was able to discover many things I hadn't known about the aforementioned government. This is one of the most intelligent novels I've read. And I urge everyone to give this wonderful and literary work a whirl.
Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed),A Customer,5,"As a teacher in Global Management we discuss different cultures, so this novel is really a fantastic scenario to learn about chinese geisha ladies. Also Mother Earth is one of my favorites. Dr. Brunilda Marrero"
Dark Light (Doc Ford Novels),Harriet Klausner,5,"The Category Four hurricane struck hard on Florida's west coast especially devastating many of the Gulf islands. Doc Marian Ford sees first hand the damage to Sanibel Island with his home, marina and lab severely damaged by the intense storm and he received a deep gash from a flying object courtesy of the hurricane.Jeth, Tomlinson and other Sanibel residents find pieces of German artifacts probably from a sunken submarine that caused havoc in the Gulf of Mexico during WWII. Not long afterward Jeth discovers the submarine.Mildred Chestra Engle asks Doc Ford to investigate what happened to a beloved who vanished while meeting a German submarine six decades ago. Chestra wants to prove he was not a traitor only a blackmail victim. Feeling her sorrow, Doc takes on the case, but nothing soon seem real even her story or for that matter her age, which changes every time he sees her. Danger finds Doc because others like salvager Heller have differing plans for Ford's client and the submarine; no one will stand in his way to achieve them.The prime storyline starts a bit later than usual as the key players and their motivations and the force of a category four hurricane are prefaced (though Katrina makes that level storm needing no introduction) to the reader. These subplots quickly merge into a delightful Doc Ford thriller. The marine biologist struggles with the wrongfully defined case, the enigmatic female that has Tomlinson thinking ghost while Doc kisses her when she does not look too old, and the thirst for revenge by Heller. Fans will enjoy DARK LIGHT as nothing is quite like it seems especially in the aftermath of a hurricane named Chestra.Harriet Klausner"
NEEDFUL THINGS,A Customer,5,This is one of my favorite Stephen King novels. Unfortunately the number of typos in this electronic edition take away from the enjoyment of reading it.
"Kiss and Tell (The Men of T-FLAC: The Wrights, Book 2)",Harriet Klausner,5,"With the recent death of her beloved grandmother, illustrator Marnie Wright needs some alone time to reassess her life. Over the objection of her father and four older brothers, Marnie accompanied by her Great Dane Duchess travels to her grandmother's cabin in the Sierra Mountains. However, her idyll time is interrupted when she meets Soldier of Fortune magazine pinup Jake Dolan, who wants nothing to do with his temporary neighbor.However, everything changes when a storm destroys her cabin, but before she can settle in his place, five hit men arrive planning to kill Jake.

Although he mistrusts her after a previous woman betrayed him, Jake and Marnie begin to fall in love even as he goes about dispatching the enemy.KISS AND TELL is an entertaining romantic suspense that never eases up on the full speed ahead throttle. The lead couple is a dynamic pair, especially the incredibly brave Marnie. Her comments as the danger mounts are priceless. Though the underground lair seems stretched, readers will fully enjoy Cherry Adair's delightful tale.Harriet Klausne"

Full of Grace: A Novel,Harriet Klausner,4,"In South Carolina, New Jersey expatriates Big Al and Connie Russo worry about their daughter Maria Graziella living in sin with scientist Dr. Michael. They want their daughter to marry and no matter how many Hail Mary's and rosary beads used, so far Grace as she prefers to be called now that they no longer live among the Neapolitan-Americans refuses to honor her mother and father by saying I do.Thirty-two years old Grace loves her parents but also enjoys her commitment free relationship with Michael. He reciprocates though he muses she has saved him a fortune on little things like unnecessary dry cleaning and when no one is around, he admits that he loves his Grace. Adding to her parents concern over her lifestyle is that Grace has also stopped going to church; they blame the ""atheist"" she shacks up with. A family crisis forces a generational confrontation between the Catholic old country Italian-American parents and their assimilated Americanized offspring.Though South Carolina is the location for this fine generational relationship war, unlike Dorothea Benton Frank's ""Lowcountry tales, the geography is irrelevant for the most part except to take the family out of Jersey, but not the Jersey out of the family. The story line focuses on commitments as Grace avoids them to her family, her lover, and even the church as if the word means disease. The story line focuses on Grace's relationships with those she loves from the perspective of her lack of enthusiasm towards strengthening any of them. Though the tale lacks action, fans who appreciate an insightful look at the importance of committing one's heart and soul to those they love will want to read Dorothea Benton Frank's pleasant story.Harriet Klausner"
"Mistress of the Pearl (The Pearl, Book 3)",Harriet Klausner,5,"Though they have pretty much conquered the planet Kundala after a century plus of resistance, the victorious aliens V'ornn remain in combat with the locals. The natives believe their Messiah, the ""Dar Sala-at"" will save them. Just the Kundalan belief that their legendary savior will help them overthrow the V'ornn invaders has lifted the spirits of the natives and helped them resist the intruders though how someone can join two spirits from opposite poles of the universe as the fabled champion will do seems hard to fathom especially by the V'ornn.However, the impossible occurs when a Kundala female Riane contains her own soul and that of the dead Annon, ironically a V'ornn; the merger of two essences from opposite sides of the universe. The Kundalans believe that Riane is the Messiah who will vanquish the conquerors, but to do so they must obtain the mystical Pearl that only the true Dar Sala-at can yield its power.Part humor, part military science fiction, and part fantasy, the third Pearl tale is a gem of a novel that uses amusing satirical slapstick moments to ease some of the major tension. The story line is action-packed and filled with adventure as series fans will delight in the rebellion but especially with the paradox of Riane-Annon. New readers will enjoy the tale as it is a stand alone, but even greater understanding especially with the V'ornn will occur by reading the delightful previous two epics (see RING OF THE FIVE DRAGONS and THE VEIL OF A THOUSAND TEARS).Harriet Klausner"
The Pursuit of Alice Thrift,Harriet Klausner,4,"Boston surgical intern Alice Thrift is a genius with an IQ in the stratosphere and a Harvard degree. Ray Russo is street educated dropped out.

Ray is a mean man while Leo and Sylvie are people the audience would like as friends. The bittersweet story line may seem rough to romance readers, but actually salutes friendship when one thinks a friend in need is a pest and prefers not to become involved, but does so anyway.Harriet Klausner"
Catch a Dream,Harriet Klausner,4,"In an isolated part of Yellowstone, Edward deserts his girlfriend-employee Meg Delaney after they argue over a business deal interrupting their camping trip. With no identification, cash, or future, Meg ponders her immediate predicament when rancher Zack Burkhart, searching for a misplaced llama, finds Meg and rescues her.Zach takes Meg to his Idaho ranch where she meets his lonely grieving son still seeking his deceased mother.

As they fall in love, she knows she is big city and he still mourns his wife's death. Will these two individuals realize in time that together they can CATCH A DREAM.Fans of seemingly mismatched couples will fully enjoy CATCH A DREAM that stars an urbanite with a &quot;ruralite&quot; in a second chance at love tale. The story line is fun except when irritating stereotyping of his mother-in-law as a TV Indian happens resulting in a slowing down of the plot. Still, in her debut Mary Jane Meier proves she has talent to make her writing dream happen.Harriet Klausner"
The Dragon Reborn: Book Three of 'The Wheel of Time',Harriet Klausner,4,"The legend says that the power of the individual who is THE DRAGON REBORN will save the world by destroying it. Signs point that the time for the appearance of the One is now so different wannabes and hanger on retinues journey to the Heart of the Stone locale of the sword Callandor that only the Reborn can yield.Rand, sole user of the One Power, believes he is destiny's darling. He leaves behind friends like Perrin and his teacher Moriaine to begin his quest for the sword. Perrin joins forces with Moiraine and others trailing after Rand. However evil abounds in the land as the hideous Black Ajah not only proves to exist in reality, but has a plan too. Allies and enemies will assemble at the Heart of the Stone where Rand will try to grab Callandor to defeat his amoral opponents while claiming the mantra of the DRAGON UNBORN.Though well written and filled with incredible detail that vividly describes a world and gives depth to the key cast members so that the Jordan realm seem real, the theme of THE DRAGON REBORN is typical of many Tolkien fantasy adventure series. Still Robert Jordan is quite a talent and provides profundity to all of the ten Wheel of Time books so that the audience knows this magical domain exists outside the fertile imagination of the author. That is the charm of the series. This particular novel is a trade reprinting of the third tale and can stand alone, but is easier to understand early on if one has read the first two stories.Harriet Klausner"
RED LEAVES,Harriet Klausner,5,"In the burbs, Eric and Meredith Moore seem to live a happy life together raising their son Keith now a teenager. Neighbors Vincent and Karen Giordano are taking visiting family out so they ask Keith to baby-sit their eight year old daughter Amy, which he agrees to do. These are normal events in a quiet suburban setting.However, the next morning Eric learns that Amy is missing. The police suspect Keith of foul play. Eric and Meredith insist their son is a good kid and would never harm Amy yet deep down in his gut he at least agrees with the prevailing community opinion that Keith committed an atrocity especially as the days pass, the posters fade, and his son seems different. Eric ponders DNA as his father left the family nearly bankrupt; his brother is an alcoholic; his sister is dead from a brain tumor; and finally his mother is suicidal. He begins to look deeper at Meredith wondering if her tree augments the worst from his with the culmination being they raised a teen killer.RED LEAVES is more of a family drama than a typical thriller as the audience observes the emotional deterioration of Eric over the course of the story line. While readers will wonder what happened to Amy, Eric's darkening look at his family members make the tale as his shell of middle class trust in what he loves erodes away with every gloomy thought he makes. Thomas H. Cook writes a deep dark tale with a finale that will stun readers as behind every so called perfect family lies hidden skeletons that can consume those concealing the truth from themselves and others.Harriet Klausner"
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Other Stories,A Customer,5,"This novel is a classic for many reasons. The writting is masterful, the plot is fanciful yet can be applied to everyone, and the characters are so well portrayed that you fear for them as the story progresses. Overall, Robert Louis Stevenson deserves his place among some of the greatest writers among his, or any, era."
Song Of Unmaking,Harriet Klausner,5,"Euan Rohe, a Caletanni barbarian almost brought the Empire and the Emperor to its knees during the Great Dance. Valeria, a rider of the wild stallions who are gods made flesh, finished the Dance with her own and seven other stallions and for a time war was averted. Valeria returns to the mountain for more training while Euan escapes to his homeland and allies himself with Gothard, the baseborn son of the Emperor who wants to Unmake his father's empire.War is coming and the Emperor, his warriors and his mages are at the border waiting for the right time to strike out at their enemy. Gothard has a stone that has the power to Unmake, once he knows how to use it. Valeria and her lover Kerrick, with their stallion gods travel to the battleground to stop Gothard before he starts using the stone's power to crush the Emperor's forces. Partners in love and battle Kerrick and Valeria perform a Dance unlike any dance the stallions performed, one that will determine the fate of the Empire.This is the second book in this magnificent romantic fantasy series (See THE MOUNTAIN'S CALL) and it is full of more action, romance and drama than its prequel. The love Kerrick and Valeria feel for each other is tested by secrets he keeps from his lover and the wounds that refuse to heal, both magical and physical, inflicted on him by his half-brother. The battle scenes are magnificent, the characters are realistic and the storyline is pure magic; readers will eagerly await the next book in this tantalizing series.Harriet Klausner"
Wisdom's Daughter: A Novel of Solomon and Sheba,Harriet Klausner,5,"With the deaths of her daughter and granddaughter, Queen Bilgis of Sheba needs a true female heir to one day replace her on the throne. She prays to the Goddess she worships, who tells her that she will find the sire of her heir in the Land of Israel. Thus Bilgis treks to Jerusalem seeking the designated one.In Jerusalem, King Solomon rules wisely over a land of milk and honey, but worries about who will replace him on the throne. The best candidate is his daughter Baalit, but females cannot rule Israel unlike Sheba. Bilgis and Solomon appreciate the wisdom they see in one another; Bilgis also sees astuteness in Baalit, who she feels should be named successor. As Solomon's wives battle behind curtains encouraged by the sanctimonious Prophet Alijah to influence the king to dump the pagan, Bilgis tries to persuade her lover that his teenage daughter should become the next ruler as she is the best suited of his children.This insightful and believable retelling of the classic Solomon-Sheba match up brings to life the era yet places a mesmerizing spin on Queen Bilgis quest in seeking the King of the Jews. The comparison between the equal rights Sheba with its matriarchal primogeniture vs. the patriarchal Israel is an interesting perspective (perhaps too modernized for that era) while the court intrigue of Solomon's wives provides a glimpse of the personal agendas and thus the times. The most interesting gyration is that Alijah comes across as a holier-than-thou preacher warning the King about his tryst with the pagan and coaxing his wives to stir trouble. As with the QUEENMAKER, India Edghill puts a female twist to heroes of the bible.Harriet Klausner"
Hannibal (Hannibal Lecter),A Customer,1,"In &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; Thomas Harris has Dr. Hannibal Lecter tell Clarice, &quot;The world is a more interesting place with you in it.&quot;Mr. Harris would do well to heed his character's advice. In &quot;Hannibal,&quot; he removes Clarice from his fictional world in the worst way imaginable - not by allowing her a hero's death, but rather by subverting her until she becomes as depraved as her nemesis.Mr. Harris's world is filled with monsters. That is to be expected by anyone who has read his previous novels or seen the movies that were made from them. But in &quot;Hannibal,&quot; unlike the other two novels, there is no heroism, no integrity, no justice. There is simply evil - everywhere, in everyone. And that, more than any monsters Mr. Harris can dream up, makes &quot;Hannibal&quot; a dull and disappointing read."
Petals on the wind,CoffeeGurl,5,"""We lived in the attic.Christopher, Cory, Carrie and me--Now there are only three.""And those three (sans Cory) manage to escape the horrible attic at Foxworth Hall. Once they discover that their mother has been poisoning their doughnuts with arsenic, they knew they'd have to run away if they had any chance to survive. Their plan is to work at a circus until they make enough money to fulfill their dreams. Chris wants to be a doctor and Cathy wants to be a prima ballerina. But things don't work out the way they'd planned. Instead, they meet a lonely doctor who takes them under his care. He pays for Chris's medical education, sends Carrie to a private school (with disastrous results), and falls in love with Cathy, who becomes a famous ballerina for some time. Things appear to look up for the ""Dresden Dolls,"" as they were known as children. However, they may have left the attic, but the horrible memories from that attic haven't left them -- especially for Cathy. Everything that goes wrong in her life has a scapegoat: her mother. A mother that leaves her children to wither away and die in an attic just so she could inherit millions and marry a younger man. Through tragic deaths, bad marriages, inappropriate incestuous feelings, and clandestine affairs, Cathy manages to carry her one-track determination to make her mother pay for everything she has put her through...Petals on the Wind is flooring. It's better than Flowers in the Attic -- more haunting and thought provoking. You feel the psychological trauma and emotional scars the characters feel. You feel awful for Cathy and Chris, even when they fight for the forbidden desires and feelings a brother and sister shouldn't feel towards one another (well, Cathy does most of the fighting, for Chris is determined to live a life of sin with his sister). Incest is one of the main themes in this series. Even though the scenes centered on incest are disturbing and difficult to read at times, it is understandable that the author develops this storyline, for nature versus nurture is another main theme in this series. It appears that the less Cathy wants to be like her mother, the more she finds herself doing the very things her mother would do. Carrie's story, while short and somewhat underdeveloped, is the saddest of them all. You feel her anguish, her inferiority complex, her fear of rejection, and you'd be made of stone if you weren't touched by her sad story. All of the characters are complex and well written, all with shades of gray, none of them perfect. V.C. Andrews was a wonderful writer of gothic suspense. I have If There Be Thorns and Seeds of Yesterday lined up, and will also pick up the prequel called Garden of Shadows. If you haven't read V.C. Andrews, then hurry up and pick up this series. Don't let the controversial theme put you off. This is great writing, folks!"
Thief Of Hearts,CoffeeGurl,5,"Having read Undead and Unwed, I wanted to read more of Mary Janice Davidson's books, especially the erotic novels she wrote for Ellora's Cave. Obtaining a copy of Thief of Hearts wasn't easy, for it is out of print, but I'm sure glad I was able to get a used copy! This fun, sexy novel enthralled me from beginning to end! Sparks fly between Dr. Jared Dean and Kara. Jared thinks Kara is special, but he becomes even more impressed when he discovers that she's tried to protect him from dangerous mobsters. Kara is a modern, female version of Robin Hood -- she steals from mobsters and drug lords to provide for the poor. And now she's taken a particular interest in Jared's safety. And that is how a steamy, original and entertaining love story begins. There are various twists throughout the novel.This novel is full of Davidson's signature sharpness and wit. I've noticed that her novels have an awful lot of banter -- a significant part of her writing style. The erotic scenes are sensual and original. I am hooked with this author. Her crisp dialogue and wonderful storytelling are addicting. I can't wait to read her other novels, especially Undead and Unemployed, the sequel to Undead and Unwed, for I have a particular interest in her paranormal stories. In the meantime, I recommend this wonderful gem. That is if you're able to obtain a copy."
Hide in Plain Sight[hardcover],Harriet Klausner,5,"Five years ago in Los Angeles her husband Richard apparently drove in to the river, but no body was found so Kennedy Antiquarian Books storeowner Fiona Kennedy was left to linger in a nowhere zone between married and single. Now her time is up in marital purgatory and she can officially have the court rule that her spouse is dead. She plans to celebrate her widow status with fun and sun in the Bahamas.However, before she can leave town, Griff Laughton asks her to authenticate and appraise an old manuscript. Griff hides his real agenda from her, which is to capture his enemies von Lahr while also protecting the bookworm from enemies she does not know she has that her late spouse has brought her. He also conceals his work of fifteen years destroying art, artifacts, and antiquities smuggling rings. He is a bit disturbed to find he is attracted to the charming beautiful Fiona, but detachment is his middle name until someone tries to kill the woman he willingly would die for to keep her safe.HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT is a fabulous fast-paced tale starring a courageous female and the male champion risking all especially his heart to keep her safe. The story line is filled with action from the moment Griff hires Fiona and never slows down as her past comes back to haunt her in spite of her innocence from Richard's dealings. The changing relationship between the hardened agent and the bookseller is deftly handled in a believable manner that in turn augments the prime plot of a woman in peril over something she knows nothing about. Readers will appreciate Michelle Albert's superb romantic suspense thriller.Harriet Klausner"
The ivy tree (A Crest book),CoffeeGurl,5,"Connor ""Con"" Winslow is the great-nephew of Matthew Winslow, master of the Whitescar estate. Con works the lands and is considered a ""poor relation,"" which means that the estate will be left to one of his young female cousins instead. Annabel, who became his fianc&eacute;e, left eight years ago and is now presumed dead. Now Matthew is considering leaving everything to his other granddaughter Julie. But then something happens. A young woman named Mary Grey appears as if from nowhere. She looks so much like Annabel Winslow that Connor at first thinks it is she who has returned to claim what is hers. But when this is proven otherwise, he makes an offer the girl cannot refuse: pretend to be Annabel Winslow so that her grandfather makes her his main beneficiary. Then, after the old man dies, she'd pass everything on to Connor. She'd get a good sum of money for her troubles. Mary has traveled to England all the way from Canada and is barely making ends meet working as a waitress. She could use the money. What could possibly go wrong?As I read the story, I was mentally giving The Ivy Tree three stars, possibly two. Why? Well, I was confused throughout most of the thing. For about three quarters of the book, the storyline and narrative were sketchy at best. I'd give the story away if I supply further details, so I won't do that. Suffice it to say that everything makes perfect sense by the end of the book, making this one of the cleverest suspense novels I have read in a long time. Mary Stewart is quickly becoming a favorite of mine. I loved Nine Coaches Waiting and I adore this one. What's more, you can truly see the novels that have influenced this particular story. Whitescar reminds me a great deal of Manderley in Rebecca (especially when Mary describes the rhododendrons) and Connor seems like a more sinister version of Max de Winter. In some areas, the story of Annabel and her secret lover is kind of similar to Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester. Stewart knew her gothic classics, and she emulated them without losing her very own touch of literary magic. I cannot recommend this novel enough. I wish it had been longer though. Two-hundred and twenty-three pages are simply not enough."
Cat in an Orange Twist: A Midnight Louie Mystery (Midnight Louie Mysteries),Harriet Klausner,5,"Life has been quiet for public relation specialist Temple Barr for the last few weeks. She has not been involved in any homicide investigations, nobody she knows has been involved in a crime, and Max Kinsella disappeared from her life again.

Wolfskin,Harriet Klausner,4,"Ulf, already a Viking warrior Wolfskin, learns about a magical place across the sea. Believing there must be plenty of treasure and a chance to do honorable deeds in Thor's name, he decides to sail for the Orkney Islands. Young Eyvind sees this as his chance to become a Wolfskin and pleads his way onto the crew.They reach this land, but find friendly people led by a kind-hearted king Angus who are willing to share their bounty with the ""invaders"".

WOLFSKIN takes no prisoners as the audience observes a hostile world even when the two groups forge an alliance. The key to this powerful historical is the cast as Eyvind, Nessa, and Somerled seem genuine and their ""triangle"" makes for great insightful reading. Ms. Marillier shows why she is among the top writers of historical fantasy with a fabulous opening novel that will excite readers with its depth.Harriet Klausner"
Hissy Fit,CoffeeGurl,5,"This is the first Mary Kay Andrews novel that I've read. It won't be the last. Hissy Fit is one of the funniest chick-lit novels I have recently read. Andrews reminds me of Marian Keyes in the way that she mixes lighthearted humor with dark subject matters. But Andrews adds her Southern charm in this book. Keeley Murdock is a successful interior designer engaged to A.J. Jernigan -- the most gorgeous, not to mention richest man in Madison, Georgia. But things take an awkward spin after she discovers her fiance knocking boots with her maid of honor during the rehearsal dinner. Outraged, she throws a hissy fit in front of everyone -- including the social-conscious Jernigans -- before she calls off the wedding. The hissy fit costs her dearly, for the Jernigans are determined to sabotage Keeley's interior design business. But they aren't counting on Will Mahoney, a handsome millionaire with a sizable, not to mention strange, business proposal for Keeley. Keeley tries to rebuild her business and reputation while searching for the mother who had abandoned her when she was a child. Things don't look too good for Keeley. There are some big twists throughout the novel.This novel blew me away. It has the perfect combination of wit and poignancy. Keeley is a Southern gal that holds no prisoners when it comes to preserving or regaining her self-respect. What surprises me most about her is that she isn't as whiny as the female leads of this sort of novel. Thus, you can identify with her plights without wanting to strangle her. I also loved the characters Gloria, Will and Austin. They made me laugh a lot. I hated Stephanie the minute she was introduced. I knew she'd be annoying. And, as mentioned earlier, I love the mixture of chic, lighthearted humor and dark, sometimes satirical situations. Mary Kay Andrews is the American Marian Keyes and Anna Maxted. I love her and I shall definitely give her other novels a whirl. In the meantime, I highly recommend Hissy Fit."
Hissy Fit,Harriet Klausner,4,"In Madison, Georgia, interior decorator Keeley Rae Murdock lives her life in accordance with her profession down to the tiniest iota. The twenty-eight year old feels everything is perfect until she finds her fianc&eacute; Andrew Jackson ""A.J."" Jernigan and her maid of honor Paige Plummer having a go hiccups and all during the wedding rehearsal dinner. Keeley has a HISSY FIT that every local resident heard about, but especially comes to the attention of wealthy newcomer Will Mahoney.Will decides that Keeley is perfect for restoring the dilapidated mansion he purchased that he plans to use to court the woman he desires that he has never met in person only on TV. Keeley prefers to reject Will as a client as it seems impossible to decorate a home with no idea of the benefactor of her work, but her ex and his banking family are trying to destroy her business so she accepts the assignment.This dark comedy will keep readers' attention as southern small town secrets begin to surface including one involving Keeley's vanished mom. The story line offers an intriguing look at home furnishing mostly through the discerning eye of the heroine. Though much of the support cast is one dimensional especially that asinine jerk A.J. while Will's woman is kept somewhat shadowy on purpose, fans will appreciate Keeley's HISSY FIT that hooks the audience expecting more outbursts from this steel magnolia.Harriet Klausner"
The Enchanted Land (Romance Alive),CoffeeGurl,4,"Jude Deveraux is one of my all-time favorite romance authors. A Knight in Shining Armor is my favorite romance novel to date, and her other works have been absolutely wonderful. I'd had The Enchanted Land on my TBR pile for almost two years. This is her first novel, I believe, and I didn't know if it would be as good as her later work. Well, this isn't her best work, but it is nevertheless wonderful, and it came during a time when I craved a good Americana. Morgan Wakefield needs her inheritance. If she doesn't get married, then everything will go to her uncle. So she makes a deal with Seth Coulter: they get married, stay married for a year so that she could get her inheritance, and then annul the marriage and pay Coulter twenty-five thousand dollars for his trouble. They cannot consummate their marriage if they want an annulment, which means that they cannot have sex. That shouldn't be so difficult. After all, Morgan is a plain girl, or at least that's what her mother has always told her. The only remarkable thing about her is her beautiful golden hair. But the fact is that Morgan is beautiful, very beautiful, underneath the drab clothes and shy exterior. Imagine how difficult things get between Morgan and Seth while they travel together to his home in New Mexico. How could they annul their marriage if it gets consummated? The sexual tension between them is almost unbearable, and the feelings that transpire between them are strong. But soon things tear them apart -- misunderstandings, tragedies, villains - making a reconciliation seem impossible.This beautiful romance will hook you in with its numerous twists and turns. Jude Deveraux writes two sorts of novels: the detailed, overdeveloped ones and the shorter, somewhat abrupt ones. This one falls into the former category. I wish she'd find some middle ground like she did with novels like Sweet Liar and The Heiress. Even though I enjoyed this novel, it does get a little long-winded about three quarters through it. But one thing is certain -- you never know which direction the story will take. It is very unpredictable, something that seldom happens in romance novels. Deveraux has a wonderful way of developing the love between the two main characters. She doesn't tell you they fall in love; she SHOWS you! You *believe* they are in love, and when a misunderstanding occurs, you become frustrated and root for a big reconciliation. This novel does not disappoint in that area. Another great thing about The Enchanted Land is the 1850s setting and the historical references with regards to the California gold rush. Americanas are few and far in between these days, and this classic gives you a clear picture of the time period. Deveraux has covered various time periods, but she is best at writing Americana and Medieval stories. Are you in the bargain for a beautiful, emotionally-driven romance with lots and lots of twists? Then The Enchanted Land is the one for you. Springtime is here, and I look forward to reading great romances like this one. I hope they're out there, because the newest romances (including the ones by Deveraux) leave a lot to be desired."
The Enchanted Land (Romance Alive),A Customer,4,Even though it is a very abridged audio cassette only 1 tape and about 90 minutes I liked the story and thought they did a great job within such a short time and I really enjoyed listening to it and since I was having trouble reading because a family emergency left me with no time to read and the stress was making it difficult for me to concentrate on reading which was vey hard because I was such a major bookworm I decided to try listening to audio cassettes in the hope of jump starting myself into reading again and I just thought this was the perfect length and I'm glad I listened to this tape and I liked the characters the guy named Seth Colter and the lady named Morgan Wakefield
The Judgment,Harriet Klausner,5,"Circuit Court Judge Calvin Jeffries ranked with this country's best legal minds, but his reputation to the public involved over use perhaps abuse of court power. Many attorneys who felt Jeffries unfairly undermined a defense were not toasting the deceased. However, surprisingly, the individual who murdered the Judge in the court parking lot was a homeless person not connected to the victim. Attorney Joseph Antonelli, not a Jeffries fan, accepts the defense of the accused judge killer.When the suspect kills himself, the case seems over, but Jeffries' widow thinks otherwise. Soon someone murders a second judge and the police shout copycat and arrest another homeless person. Antonelli begins to wonder if Mrs. Jeffries is right that something more sinister is the cause behind the homicides and who is next?The story line of THE JUDGMENT is a fast-paced, exciting legal thriller. The cast is fully drawn and seem real, especially the hero and the first dead Judge. Though Antonelli speaks in a stilted tongue in what sounds like to much legalese for everyday discussions, he remains a powerful caring character who readers will like but ask him to speak in plain English. D.W. Buffa provides the audience with a strong legal thriller that fans will enjoy, but need a few days to read.Harriet Klausner"
"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)",Harriet Klausner,5,"No one really knows how old allegedly twenty-one years old Ukiah Oregon is. He was found caught in a wolf trap when he was approximately twelve. The woman who captured Ukiah took him to Pittsburgh so she and her female mate Lara could have a child since the courts ignored adoption efforts by a same sex couple.Now Ukiah works with private detective Max Bennett. Ukiah is a world-class tracker who can find a trail with the faintest of clues. There are other oddities about Ukiah. His olfactory, taste, and hearing senses are much more acute than the average person's and he can read DNA with another unknown sense. He has suffered strange memory losses that only sometimes he regains. On one of his cases, Ukiah learns about The Pack, a loose coalition of bikers who take a sudden interest in him. When he finds out why, he also learns he is the key to saving the human race.ALIEN TASTE is an urban science fiction tale that takes place on earth in three years. However, new technological advances make the reader feel that Wen Spencer's tale takes place much further into the future. The characters are fully developed and understandable and The Pack is likable in a feral sort of way. This novel is keeper shelf material and hopefully Mr. Spencer will return with more tales starring the Pack.Harriet Klausner"
Enchanted Afternoon,Harriet Klausner,4,"Inventor Professor Michael Rowen breaks the heart of Helena Cabot because he believes she, as the daughter of the most powerful US Senator, would never marry him. Pregnant with Michael's child, Helena turns to New York's Junior Senator Troy Barnes. They forge a loveless marriage of convenience that has fooled the international upper crust into believing this couple shares the perfect matrimony.Almost a decade later, two events destroy the Barnes couple alliance. First her father dies leaving Helena with no protector. Second Troy learns that William is not from his seed. Fearing retribution for herself and her son from her authoritative abusive husband, Helena tries to obtain a divorce, but no attorney will go up against Troy. Desperate she flees to Upstate New York and opens a woman's shelter, but also turns to Michael for help. Though neither trusts one another William is Michael's son and Helena, knowing Troy has a rep to maintain, is coming.Names aside (Helena and Troy!), ENCHANTED AFTERNOON is an exciting nineteenth century romantic intrigue that provides readers with a vivid look at the plight of women in a society granting no rights. The story line is fast-paced once the key cast members are introduced so that the reader understands how they react to tribulations. Though how Troy hid his true colors from his spouse even if she lived in Sarasota Springs while he in Georgetown for much of that time seems a stretch, the audience will relish Susan Wiggs delightful historical tale.Harriet Klausner"
A Thousand Tomorrows (Cody Gunner Series #1),Harriet Klausner,5,"Champion bull rider Cody Gunner uses brashness to hide his heart from everyone except his younger brother Carl, a Down syndrome person. Cody detests his former NFL great father who he worshiped until dad walked out on his family once he concluded that his youngest son was defective.

The story line grips the audience from the start and never lets up until the final soliloquy. The plot especially the ending is obvious because of the realistic portrayal of CF; fans who appreciate an uplifting somewhat melancholy tale will appreciate Karen Kingsbury character driven inspirational.Harriet Klausner"

Coldwater Revival: A Novel,Harriet Klausner,5,"In 1933, three weeks before Emma Grace Falin is to marry Gavin O'Donnell, she heads home to Two Toe Creek to confront her past. She knows if she fails to reconcile with the death of her younger brother she cannot offer her full heart to the deserving Gavin. Five years may have passed since the incident that shaped her, but Emma still mourns the loss and feels guilty for causing it. She has even shunned God.Five years ago her family also devastated by the death, cannot cope with Emma, who wants to die. They send her to Galveston praying her grandmother will help her heal. There she meets Tate, who has suffered the loss of loved ones, but still believes snugly in the Lord and lives life to the fullest. Tate knows he loves Grace, but hides his feelings from her as he knows she is not ready for a relationship. Now she is engaged to someone else, but he trusts that God will show both of them the way.Besides a strong look at the healing process, this deep inspirational tale provides a powerful sense of time and locale as the audience obtains a taste of Texas during the Depression. Emma is a wonderful protagonist as she holds the historical drama together with her first person account of the past and present. The support cast, predominantly seen through their respective relationships with Emma, augments the audience's understanding that the lead character lacks confidence in her self, her family, and the Lord as she struggles to understand why bad things happen to good people.Harriet Klausner"
Berried Alive: A Manor House Mystery,Harriet Klausner,5,"World War II is causing hardship for those left behind especially in the small village of Sitting Marsh where women and men unable too serve have to keep their spirits up as they try to do the work of the men now at the front.

The heroine is a strong-minded woman who leads by example with action and kindness especially to those less fortunate than herself. The secondary cast is a delightful bunch of eccentrics, who add humor when the plot turns too maudlin.Harriet Klausner"
"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)",Harriet Klausner,5,"The underground city of Atlantis is real and in the present day and is guarded by the shapeshifter Dragon Darius en Kragin who kills anyone who enters the city through the portal and the mist.

The Picture of Dorian Gray (Penguin Classics),CoffeeGurl,5,"That famous quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet certainly applies to Dorian Gray. And Lord Henry Wotton couldn't help using this quote, much like he couldn't help baiting Dorian Gray. Lord Henry admires the man in Basil Hallward's new portrait so much that he has got to meet him. Is he as beautiful in real life as he is in the painting? Is he ever! He is an Adonis, a young man as pure on the inside as he is on the outside. No wonder Hallward is obsessed with him! So begins Lord Henry's attempts to corrupt the young man. In no uncertain terms, he tells Dorian Gray that ""beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances."" He also goes on to tell him that his wonderful youth and good looks are his best qualities, too bad someday they will fade. Dorian Gray is upset. His portrait will remain young and beautiful forever, whereas he will age and lose with his physical beauty. If only it were the other way around...That is all I'll share in terms of plot. You have got to read this magnificent novel to know the rest. The Picture of Dorian Gray, first published in 1890, is one of the most disturbing works of fiction I have ever read. No wonder it is so popular! It is thought provoking from beginning to end. Dorian is a cross between Narcissus and Faust -- his vanity is obvious from the very start, and Lord Henry is depicted as a devil, whereas Hallward is the angel who tries to maintain Dorian's innocence. Yes, as it has often been observed, the novel does have some not-so-concealed references to homosexuality. The aforementioned theme, mainly noticeable in Hallward, is, in the words of Marianne Dashwood in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, ""implied but never declared."" There was no need for Wilde to say it in so many words, but he dropped hints here and there, like the rumors that Hallward moved to San Francisco. I doubt he would have been able to be more inconspicuous in his time. This novel could cover long hours of discussion. There are so many themes and symbolism and magic realism and foreshadowing here, and Lord Henry's crude but honest musings and observations are fascinating. He is definitely the most interesting character in the book. This is my first time reading this book. I'd wanted to read it since I read Amanda Filipacchi's Nude Men ten years ago. Why it took me so long to give it a whirl I will never know. Better late than never, I guess. And if you haven't read it, well, need I suggest that you do? You won't regret it. This is nineteenth century literature at its finest."
The Picture of Dorian Gray (Penguin Classics),A Customer,5,"This story combine the wishes of a fountain of youth with a feel of black magic. The main character Dorian is a young, rich, and handsome man whose face is painted by an inspired painter who seeks notiriety in his work. Only later Dorian realizes that his imperfections are translated to the painting."
Star Wars Survivor's Quest,Harriet Klausner,5,"Over fifty years ago Thrawn destroyed the Outbound Flight containing some Jedi. Now on the planet Nirauan, aliens have found the remains of the Outbound Flight. They want to hand over their find to the New Republic. Knowing the diplomatic value of accepting this ""gift"" and the internal appreciation of leaving no one behind, leaders of the New Republic send the Skywalkers to Niraua, graveyard to over fifty-thousand.Master Jedi Luke Skywalker and Jedi Knight wife Mara Jade discuss technology on the journey as the duo still struggle to adjust to married life with missions seemingly always happening.

Some are enemy survivors of the post-Palpatine Empire while others are New Republic ""allies"" with their own agenda. Though the simple trip turns dangerous as foes seek the annihilation of the Skywalkers and the destruction of their allies, the biggest mystery resides inside the massive hulk.Aimed at teenage Star war fans, this stand alone thriller is a superb action and adventure tale that spins somewhat like an out in space epic sword and sorcery story. Luke and Mara is a delightful pair though many old-timers will need to adapt to the young Jedi master having a wife (can Jedi kiddies be far behind""). The twists and turns add excitement that will please readers of all ages as once again Master Writer Timothy Zahn insures the force is with his readers.Harriet Klausner"

As the Monks work on the case, they begin to wonder who are the victims and who are the criminals?Anne Perry always writes a memorable Victorian mystery that leaves her myriad of fans shouting masterpiece. The glimpse of the American Civil War from the British side is as enlightening as much as observing the English justice system at work. SLAVES OF OBSESSION is constructed in such a way so as to the make the mystery seem obvious until the protagonists begin to dig for the truth. The novel turns into a personal coup for the author showing yet again the degree of talent and confidence Ms. Perry has.Harriet Klausner"

"37th Hour, The",Harriet Klausner,5,"Minneapolis Police Detective Sarah Pribek, an expert on missing-person cases, worries about her partner, Genevieve Brown, whose mental collapse is understandable since her daughter was recently raped and murdered. The accused Royce ""Shorty"" Stewart is free due to a legal technicality, which adds to Genevieve's stress due to a lack of justice providing her some closure.Sarah's husband, Police Detective Mike Shiloh, leaves for a four-month training class at Quantico with the FBI, but never arrives at his destination. Sarah investigates the disappearance though her peers and superiors believe Mike walked out on her after two months of marriage. Sarah finds no clues in her spouse's trek east or in his behavior just before his departure. She looks into Mike's past, but her inquiries lead to her Utah-based family while also bringing Genevieve back among the living assisting her on her quest. However, the long and winding road seems to have one more twist around the bend, but always returns to Minneapolis, but what will Sarah find at the end of this rainbow?THE 37TH HOUR is a great police procedural starring complex protagonists who in their way are as dark and foreboding as the odious Shorty is. The story line is solid, intricate, and deep as the audience follows a non-linear trail that makes for a deeper reading experience. Anyone who appreciates a powerful one sitting realistic investigative tale that contains strong convincing characters will want to read Jodi Compton's debut novel that in turn will lead to everyone hating this talented author for making novel writing seem so effortless.Harriet Klausner"
"One Night with a Spy (Royal Four, Book 3)",Harriet Klausner,5,"In 1810 twenty year old Lady Julia Barrowby is despondent when her beloved spouse septuagenarian Aldus collapses as she owes her life to him and his protection. She insures his time over the next few years is comfortable.In 1813, Aldus dies, but to the chagrin of his Royal Four mates, he as the Fox never trained an apprentice to become the Fox. Cobra, Lion, and Falcon and the Prime Minister travel to Barrowby concerned as the Royal Four has always been there to protect England from outside agents. At Barrowby, the widow Julia claims she is the Fox and has been for over three years. The Lion's prot&eacute;g&eacute; Marcus Ramsay is sent undercover to learn the truth. Marcus, expecting a gold-digger, reads her secret diary and decides to use her desires against her. Instead he finds himself falling in love with the ""Vixen"", who he realizes is better as the clever Fox than he is while an enemy of the state from her past plans to take advantage of a mere female.The third book in the Royal Four series (see SURRENDER TO A WICKED SPY and TO WED A SCANDALOUS SPY) is a terrific gender bending entry starring a strong woman who believes her deeds prove a female can be a contributing member. The key to this fine Regency romantic suspense is the change in Marcus; initially he assumes that his female rival is cotton candy of an old man, but as he falls in love he begins to realize Julia is better at the job than he is and not only wants to be her spouse and lover, but also her student. Readers will enjoy this strong entry in an exhilarating series with the climax to come.Harriet Klausner"
The Academy,CoffeeGurl,2,"I was in the bargain for a romantica centered on BDSM. I picked up The Academy because I thought it would be interesting to read a BDSM novel with a futuristic setting. Daria Evans visits the planet Utan to negotiate a billion-dollar contract for her superiors. If she succeeds, she will get a big promotion (vice president) and her fianc&eacute; will finally set a wedding date. But things don't run as smoothly in Utan as she had thought. The beings who inhabit the planet feel that Daria thinks she is superior. They also don't like that she is judgmental about their sexually uninhibited ways. So in order to get the deal for her company, she has to become part of The Academy, where she learns to shatter her innermost sexual inhibitions and experiences feelings she had never felt before in the arms of her disguised master.I like that Daria is not able to adjust to life in Utan and she feels that humans have superior intelligence and have more sexual boundaries than the Utanians. That sort of thing happens often in this world when an American visits a country they think is beneath them. I also think that her transition from a sexually repressed woman with abandonment issues to an uninhibited, wanton sexpot is quite realistic -- at least more realistic than most erotic books. However, the story development is a little too slow for my taste. Also, some of the erotic scenes are not very... well, erotic. The sex scenes were quite mechanical, especially the ones centered on Analet (a blue-skinned sex kitten from a neighboring planet called Carus) and Benwar. I could not picture blue-skinned, silver-haired people in my mind as I read the scenes. That is one of the main reasons I don't read futuristic stuff often. All in all, The Academy has an interesting premise with a realistic sexual transition. Unfortunately, the most important aspect of this sort of book -- the erotica -- failed to impress me."
The Breakup Club (Red Dress Ink Novels),Harriet Klausner,4,"At a New York publishing firm, the quartet work on a complex project, but realize they share in common that each has been involved in a recent breakup. They start to lend an ear to one another.Thirtyish Lucy Miller-Masterson is stunned that her handsome spouse, a doctor, is apparently dumping her by New Year's.

The World Still Melting,Harriet Klausner,4,"In 1980s Iowa farm country, Harvey and Nancy Riker, Burton Stone, and Paul and Arlene Tobler are neighbors. Harvey abuses Nancy who finds first solace and then love with former Nam veteran Burton. When Harvey learns of their affair, he gets a gun to kill Burton, but instead murders Paul for being a Good Samaritan by trying to stop the violence before it happens. While the grieving widow Arlene returns to her family in South Dakota, Harvey goes to prison and Nancy and Burton marry.When vagrants use the vacated Tobler home as a shelter, Burton becomes upset feeling these break-ins is blasphemy and a reminder of the cost to his friends of his happiness. He fixes a shotgun to the door so when someone opens the weapon fires at them to scare them away. Arlene's adult son Peter opens the booby trapped door only to take a shot into his knee, shattering the joint. With Harvey cheerleading Peter on, he sues Burton.THE WORLD STILL MELTING looks closely at the relationships between farmers and the land and between the farm families. The story line is a combination of a soap opera with the Grapes of Wrath battle against nature, the government and the bank. When the tale stays with farmer vs. the environment (natural and man-made), Robley Wilson cleverly uses the past to provides a well written SPLENDID OMEN of what could reoccur in the future. However, when the plot concentrates on the dysfunctional relationships, readers ask why soap up the farm.Harriet Klausner"
The Biographer's Tale,Harriet Klausner,5,"His postgraduate literary-criticism courses bore student Phineas G. Nanson, who wonders if that is all there is in life. Unable to take anymore, Phineas decides to commit university heresy and devote his time on biographies, feeling that will provide a taste of real life. He chooses the obscure works of Destry-Scholes who gave the world the consummate story of Victorian polymath Sir Elmer Bole, a nineteenth century English renaissance man.Phineas' research into his hero leads to finding partial manuscripts on Linnaeus, Galton, and Ibsen. However, as the student-scholar digs deeper into his champion's works, he finds that Desrty-Scholes has created facts to spice up the lives of his subjects. Uncovering this information makes a disappointed Phineas realize the world of biography is closer to the literary realm than he realized, but with his stiff upper lip he seem happier for the knowledge.THE BIOGRAPHER'S TALE is a series of satires that laughs at much of what modern society, especially the British, reveres from its heritage. The story line slowly evolves setting up the ironic humor. Publishers, authors, and reviewers (I included) can see ourselves alongside insects and vermin in caricatures of fun house mirror images of ourselves.Harriet Klausner"
Ruled Britannia,Harriet Klausner,5,"On an earth that never was but could have been, The Spanish Armada was triumphant and landed in England. Queen Elizabeth was sent to the London Tower and King Phillip II of Spain's daughter Isabella and her husband Albert rule the land, forcing the Protestants into hiding and making Catholicism the state religion. Spanish soldiers are an army of occupation and the English Inquisition is a powerful instrument of the church.William Shakespeare is not a political man. All he wants to do is have his plays produced for the masses to see. Will is approached by Sir William Cecil, Elizabeth's prime advisor to write a play that will appeal to England's sense of patriotism so that they will, when called upon, overthrow their Spanish masters. Will rises to the occasion and begins writing a drama while knowing that one mistake will mean his and the troupe's death by the flames.RULED BRITANNIA is a fascinating stand-alone work of alternate history as Harry Turtledove departs from his American opus to provide a compelling work that is believable and shows what might have been if the storm and Drake had not caused havoc on the Armada. Using William Shakespeare as the hero and the reluctant catalyst to signal the beginning of the revolution is an inspired plot device, one that guarantees reader interest for more than just Mr. Turtledove's legion of fans.Harriet Klausner"
Barney's Version,A Customer,5,"I really enjoyed this book. It is well written,the characters are great, and I found myselflaughing out loud while reading it. It is thebest book I have read this year. The endingis one of the best yet!"
"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)",Harriet Klausner,4,"In California, renowned artist Susa Donavon will paint a canvas in front of an audience. Her work will be auctioned as part of raising money for the Friends of Moreno County. Additionally Susa will appraise any works brought in by patrons of the arts with the money raised also donated to the Friends of Moreno County.Art buyer and artist Lacey Quinn brings in paintings done by her late grandfather in the 1920s for Susa to evaluate. Susa feels that the works owned by Lacey are from highly regarded plein air artist Lewis Marten. Though she doubts it, Lacey, already interested in the life of her relative, cannot resist researching the darker portrayals of murder, but soon finds evidence that the homicides occurred and that history repeats itself.Insight into the California art scene adds a taste of reality to a suspense-laden tale. The heroine is a delight as she seeks her place feeling like the outsider in her family especially when compared to her two siblings. The murder mystery is thirty plus years old with frozen tundra trails yet Lacey relatively easily solves them, which takes credibility away from a well written fun story that readers will still value.Harriet Klausner"
"Whitney, My Love",CoffeeGurl,4,"Based on the two- and one-star reviews here, I expected something atrocious with this effort. That wasn't the case for me. Whitney, My Love is full of McNaught's signature romance with the proverbial imperfect hero. I won't go all out and call Clayton an anti-hero, for he is a kind and gentle person for most of the novel, but since I read Once and Always before this one, Clayton to me is a boy scout compared to Jason Fielding. Having said that, I will continue to give my take on the author's first novel as soon as I give a brief synopsis of the same. Whitney Stone isn't like the other girls. She is rebellious, adventurous and full of spirit. For years, she's had a crush on Paul Sevarin and is convinced that she will win his heart once she returns to England after staying with her aunt and uncle in France, where she refines herself and becomes a proper young lady. She becomes all the rage in Paris society, where she wins the devotion of various suitors, one of which is the adorable Nicholas DuVille, but she only wants Paul in her life. What Whitney doesn't know is that a man has set his eyes on her and is willing to do anything to obtain her. And that is how Clayton Westmoreland, Duke of Claymore, pays off Whitney's father's many debts in exchange for her hand in marriage. However, it won't be easy to convince Whitney that he is the one for her, not when he has more competition for her heart than he'd bargained for. There are many twists throughout the novel.The novel has excellent story development in that we read about Whitney's growth from being a tomboy to becoming a spirited beauty. There is also a lot of development as far as Whitney and Clayton's feelings for each other are concerned. Clayton is the signature McNaught alpha male in which he is bossy, selfish, arrogant, temperamental as well as love struck and sensual. I have always thought that the heroes' tempers in McNaught novels are a bit over the top, and that is no exception here. The scene in which he takes Whitney to his bedroom and does some rather disgusting and degrading things to her disturbed me because he chooses to believe things about her before talking to her about them first. The misunderstandings here are hard to believe because they illustrate the lack of faith the hero has for the woman he supposedly loves and adores above anything and everyone. I know there was little to no communication between spouses in nineteenth century, but even then I'm sure he would have approached his fiancee/wife and asked, ""Is so and so true?"" before he practically rapes her and subjects her to all sorts of abuse. The second misunderstanding is the worst one in my opinion because he'd had lived with her and gotten to know her better and still he jumps to conclusions. Those scenes are difficult to stomach. He is far too cruel to Whitney. I see that this paperback is a re-written edition in which the author makes some changes and eliminates some of Clayton's violent outbursts. I for one am glad Ms. McNaught decided to spare her new readers from that sort of thing. Alas, I still like Clayton because he truly loves Whitney and is a great hero in spite of his stupidity. Whitney is the trademark McNaught heroine in which she is spirited, quick-witted and almost perfect. She does some annoying things of her own, but the aforementioned things were fine with me if they meant rebelling against the arrogant hero. I love the overall fluidity of the story and I adored the secondary characters as well, especially Stephen (I am so looking forward to reading Until You), Nicholas, Emily and Clayton's mother. And I love the references about the first Duke of Claymore, Royce Westmoreland and his wife Jennifer, the protagonists of the stand-alone prequel called A Kingdom of Dreams, which I've already read and loved. All in all, I enjoyed Whitney, My Love. This isn't my favorite McNaught novel though. This one will get four stars instead of five ones because there is a fundamental flaw in the storyline that centers on the hero's lack of faith in the heroine for no other reason than his being hot-tempered and having passionate-bordering-on-obsessive feelings for Whitney. The aforementioned feelings from a hero could be quite romantic, but not when extreme violence is put into the mixture. That should never be the basis for a love story. McNaught uses the same pattern in her novels (misunderstandings and lack of communication), but at least the characters in the other novels I've read had stronger, more palpable reasons for their behavior. Alas, I nevertheless enjoyed this novel and recommend it very much. And I do agree to a certain degree with the five- and four-star reviewers that say that this novel is a classic."
"Jinxed (Regan Reilly Mysteries, No. 6)",Harriet Klausner,4,"Regan Reilly and her boy friend Jack ""not related"" Reilly visit the California wine country until he has to return to his work as the head of the NYPD Major Cases Squad. Private sleuth Regan goes back to her office in Los Angeles. Almost the moment she arrives at work, Regan receives a call from the Weldon siblings, who she met when she and Jack toured their winery. Apparently their ninety-six going on ninety-three years old stepmother, former silent screen star Lucretia Standish, is getting married once again. If the Weldon trio plus the daughter of one of them all attend the ceremony, Lucretia will give them two million dollars each; if even one fails to show up they receive zero. The Weldons hire Regan to find the daughter off on one of her vanishing act weekends.Regan begins investigating and receives help from Jack via email. However, the forty something groom has other plans for his fiancee's money, which include leaving the Weldons with nothing. If it means killing a detective to insure a Weldon fails to appear so be it.JINXED is an action-packed thriller that moves at the speed of light, which leads to a fun time for the audience if one does not mind escapist cerebral cotton candy. The story line is fluff yet the audience will enjoy every page of it and most will finish in one sitting. Regan is a wonderful protagonist while readers will find the antics of the support cast quite pleasant and amusing. Carol Higgins Clark does what she does best entertain her fans.Harriet Klausner"
Nowhere Else on Earth,Harriet Klausner,5,"In 1864 Scuffletown, many mixed-breed descendants of the native Lumbee Indian Tribe laboriously toil at the turpentine business. The group is extremely poor but work hard to help their families survive. Living nearby are wealthy and powerful Scottish plantation owners who still own black slaves.

Eventually, Henry turns to robbery to survive and ultimately is accused of murder. As Henry makes love with teenager Rhoda Strong, his gentle father is hung as retribution for Henry's actions. He seeks revenge, but finds time to marry his beloved Rhoda before fleeing from the area during Reconstruction.NOWHERE ELSE ON EARTH is an incredible accomplishment that showcases the talent of Josephine Humphreys. Rhoda narrates the story line as she looks back over the years to the havoc caused by the Civil War and the Reconstruction on her indigent people. The characters are fully developed especially the interrelationships in which race rules even amidst the Northern Army. The insightful plot provides a unique look at the Civil War that allows readers to grasp the torment yet valor of a small group under siege from all sides. Ms. Humphreys uses historical facts to bring to life a People during an era when the rights of a small minority are trampled.Harriet Klausner"

Maggie's Hope,A Customer,5,"Maggie's Hope is a great summer read, specially on the beach! Reading about these robust, hearty women dealing with and overcoming hardships that we can relate to even in modern times, has given me hope that life today ain't all that bad considering the 'good old days'. There are some good characters I loved to hate but I won't say more... Too bad it isn't a paperback, but it's still worth the money."
Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels),A Customer,1,WARNING! This book suffers from being overly descriptive. This author apparantly just bought a new thesaurus and thought she should use every word in it. It is about a good a book as you would expect from an author who names her hero something so incredibly stupid as DEVIL.
Ode to a Banker,Harriet Klausner,5,"In 74 AD informer Marcus Didius Falco (in modern terms this means he is a private investigator) believes he is a talented poet. After giving a reading of his works, an employee of Aurelius Chrysippus approaches Marcus to inform him that his master, banker and owner of a scriptorium, enjoys his poetry and wants to see it published. An elated Marcus arranges to meet with Aurelius.However, his euphoria quickly ends when Falco soon learns that Aurelius expects payment for publication. Disappointed and disgusted, Falco leaves. Not long afterward, Falco learns that someone killed Aurelius shortly after their meeting. Falco is hired to find the killer, which proves arduous because the victim made so many enemies that his anti-fan club could fill the Coliseum with SRO.The twelfth Falco Ancient Rome mystery shows how the readers how the Romans feel about Greeks, banking, and publishing. In many ways, this entry is written tongue in cheek as Lindsey Davis satirizes publishing, banking, and detectives. Thus the audience obtains an educated, humorous and well-written who-done-it that retains a freshness not all series have when they reach the twelth plateau.Harriet Klausner"

Small Gods,A Customer,5,"I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat ""Bite me!""I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it."
Water of Death,Harriet Klausner,4,"In 2025, compared with the anarchy that surrounds it, Edinburgh remains a calm island of no crime. Though rationing is a way of life and entertainment only comes in the form of a festival for tourists, the clever City Council occupies the restless residents with a weekly lottery. How can individuals not play when a five-minute shower a day is a potential prize.However, a missing person interrupts the lottery nirvana when Kennedy, a winner, simply vanishes. Rumors spread quickly, and the concerned Edinburgh leadership hires private investigator Quint Dalrymple to quickly learn the truth. Before he can solve that case, murdered bodies begin to appear in the Leith, leaving the City Council in a panic, a city in fear, and a pressured Quint trying to stop a body count from growing any further.Award winning Paul Johnston's world is radically different from that of today. Global warming has reached extreme levels turning the climate into the Big Heat. Everything seems rationed and centrally controlled. Still Quint remains an interesting character with his obsession for the blues standing out in this drab world. Mr. Johnston brings in his full cast from the previous two books, but instead of the welcome return of old friends, this sends a clever story line spinning into chaos greater than his surrounding countryside. Doomsday fanatics will relish WATER OF DEATH and its predecessors for its descriptive look at an apparently dying society trying to survive. However, readers of other science fiction sub-genres will struggle with the plot's anarchy.Harriet Klausner"
